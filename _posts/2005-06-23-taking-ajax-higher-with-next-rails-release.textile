Thomas Fuchs has been doing awesome work building on top of Prototype (the Javascript engine driving Ajax in Rails) to bring us <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us: Better effects and drag'n'drop capabilities</a>. Together with the <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/articles/2005/06/22/upload-progress-stabilizing">upload progress enhancements</a> from Sean Treadway, we're going to have a big upgrade to the Ajax capabilities of Rails in the next, forthcoming release (0.13).

If you want to see what's in store for you, checkout the addition of <a href="http://backpackit.com/weblog/archives/new_features_updates/new_drag_and_drop_reordering_for_todos_and_notes.php">drag'n'drop to Backpack</a>. Shows off very nicely just how cool drag'n'drop can be in a Web 2.0 application.

There's more chatter about this on <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000468.html">Loud Thinking</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/drag_and_drop_comes_to_backpack.php?1#comments">Signal vs Noise</a>, and <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/06/22/script-aculo-us-launched">mir.aculo.us</a>.
