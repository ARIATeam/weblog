If you're deep into all the RFCs on email, we'd like your help ensuring that the latest approach to encoding with Action Mailer is sound. We're going for an approach where encoding to subjects and headers are only applied if necessary. Please do have a look at <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/955">ticket #955</a>.
