Writeboards are collaborative documents with version control, difference tracking, and comments. They're created through <a href="http://writeboard.com/">Writeboard.com</a>, the latest Rails application from 37signals. And if you happen to have a <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a>, you can even manage your Writeboards from there. It's totally free and you can create as many Writeboards as you like.

The code underneath is currently 908 lines, according to "rake stats".
