For the procrastinators out there, don't forget that the "talk proposal deadline":http://eurorails.rubycentral.org/ for the "European RailsConf":http://europe.railsconf.org is coming this Friday, July 21.

If you missed "RailsConf":http://technorati.com/search/railsconf, this is your chance to not only "attend":http://europe.railsconf.org but to _speak_ at the first ever European Rails Conference.
