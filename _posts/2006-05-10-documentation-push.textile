We've recently decided to put some work into Rails documentation. We'd like to flesh out the existing docs, add documentation for the corners that are lacking and update what may have gone stale. 

"Kevin Clark":http://glu.ttono.us/ is leading up this campaign and would like to get the help of the community at large. 

He's got a write up that goes over how you can help "Documenting Rails":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/10/documenting-rails . It summarizes what we are looking for and gives basic instructions to get those who are interested in helping up and running. The main guidelines are:
 
 * Write to teach
 * Provide examples
 * Don't restate the obvious

Good documentation patches are right up there with good code patches. If you'd like to help out Rails while gaining a deeper  understanding of how it works, taking part in this documentation project would be a great start.
