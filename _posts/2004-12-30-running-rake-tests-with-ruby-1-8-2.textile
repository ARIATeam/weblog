If you're among the early adopters of Ruby 1.8.2, you will have noticed that rake chokes when attempting to run all the tests in a suite. Thankfully, Dave Halliday was quick to "device a fix":http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/messages/2f0caa10463cdd43,91664556db859cce,ddbaa97a0aba1370,16996f85d70b1587,acfd6dbc6d7acfe3,9397986834ee6824,48f16024fe71658f,b1c3d47977f80a50,c1571c9a5b528ce0,976165a7f196648a?thread_id=c6817a557367c72d&mode=thread&noheader=1#doc_9397986834ee6824, which you can apply right away while we await a new release of Rake from Jim Weirich.
