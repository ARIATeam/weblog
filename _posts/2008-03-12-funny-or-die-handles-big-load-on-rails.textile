"Funny Or Die":http://www.FunnyOrDie.com/ is pulling high G's scaling their Rails site to handle 9GBps of video and 20MBps of compressed HTML traffic from the stunts of Will Ferrell and others. Their "top video":http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74 has been seen no less than 50 million times. Rock on, guys.
