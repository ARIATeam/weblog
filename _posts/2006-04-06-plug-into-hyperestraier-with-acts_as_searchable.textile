"Patrick Lenz":http://poocs.net has "announced":http://poocs.net/articles/2006/04/06/introducing-acts_as_searchable his @acts_as_searchable@ plugin which integrates ActiveRecord models with "HyperEstraier":http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/, an open source fulltext search engine.

It's available as a gem so you can just do @sudo gem install acts_as_searchable@.

You can then take a look at the "API docs":http://ar-searchable.rubyforge.org/, which provide a few "examples":http://ar-searchable.rubyforge.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Acts/Searchable.html.

Full text searching just got as simple as:
<pre>
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_searchable
end

Article.fulltext_search('biscuits AND gravy')
</pre>
