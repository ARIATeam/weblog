The "session schedule for RailsConf":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/grid?date=2008-05-29 is now available. A very packed lineup across Thursday through Sunday.

Also, the "early bird deal":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/register is ending April 10th. After that, the price of admission will jump another $100. So if you're planning to go, getting your ticket before April 10th would be an easy way to save a Benjamin.
