With the release of Rails 0.10.0, the reign of Apache has finally ended and equal opportunity for all web servers has been introduced. The most important beneficial of this is <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>. The server describes itself as "...a secure, fast, compliant and very flexible web-server which has been optimized for high-performance environments" and is <a href="http://weblog.textdrive.com/">catching the attention</a> of a lot of people lately.

Personally, I've been most interested in its <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/documentation/fastcgi.html">FastCGI implementation</a> that includes a load balancer component. But whether you need that or not, you owe it to yourself to check out lighttpd. Here's a sample minimal configuration file needed to setup lighttpd to run a Rails application under FastCGI:

<pre><code>
server.port = 8080
server.bind = "127.0.0.1"
# Needed on OS X: server.event-handler = "freebsd-kqueue"
 
server.modules = ( "mod_rewrite", "mod_fastcgi" )
 
url.rewrite = ( "^/$" =>"index.html", "^([^.]+)$" =>"$1.html" )
server.error-handler-404 = "/dispatch.fcgi"
 
server.document-root = "/path/application/public"
server.errorlog      = "/path/application/log/server.log"
 
fastcgi.server = ( ".fcgi" => ( "localhost" => (
 "min-procs" => 1,  "max-procs" => 5,
 "socket"   =>"/tmp/application.fcgi.socket",
 "bin-path" =>"/path/application/public/dispatch.fcgi",
 "bin-environment" => ( "RAILS_ENV" =>"development" )
) ) )
</code></pre>

This configuration is also to be found in the README file of new Rails installations.
