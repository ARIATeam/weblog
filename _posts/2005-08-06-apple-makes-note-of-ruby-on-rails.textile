On the Apple Developer site, there's a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/opensourcescripting.html">new article about open-source scripting languages</a> and how you can use Xcode to work with them. On Ruby, they note:

<blockquote> Ruby is gaining popularity as a language to write web-based applications. Ruby scripts can easily be executed with CGI, and Ruby contains a class called CGI that is used specifically for creating CGI scripts. The CGI class has methods for generating HTML and dealing with cookies, among many other capabilities. If you are considering using Ruby to write web-based applications, you won't want to miss the Ruby on Rails project. Rails is an open source web programming framework that is rapidly gaining mindshare due to its simplicity and clean design.</blockquote>

Thanks, guys.
