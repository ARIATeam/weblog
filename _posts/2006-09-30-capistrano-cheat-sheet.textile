David Pettifer has created a compact Capistrano cheat sheet in PDF format. It summarizes helper methods, pre-defined variables, standard tasks, capfile syntax, standard release directory structure, and more. So go ahead, "download it":http://dizzy.co.uk/cheatsheets/!

(For those arriving late to the party, Capistrano is a utility for executing commands in parallel on multiple remote hosts. You can read all about it in the "Capistrano manual":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17.)
