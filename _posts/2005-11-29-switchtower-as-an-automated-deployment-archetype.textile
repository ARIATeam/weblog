Mike Clark has written a provocative article entitled "SwitchTower as an Automated Deployment Archetype":http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Tools/SwitchTowerDeploymentArchetype.rdoc in which he suggests that developers of all stripes ought to consider "SwitchTower":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17 for their deployment system, whether or not they are using Ruby on Rails. I know I've heard at least one story of someone using SwitchTower to manage a PHP application. Anyone care to share any other success stories of SwitchTower managing a non-Rails application? Any gotchas potential users might want to be aware of?
