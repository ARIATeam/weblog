"RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ has been racing towards a sell-out and is now almost there. We're down to our last 100-something seats out of the 1200 being offered. So if you're still waiting for boss approval on the expenditure or want to see how close you can get to having seat #1200, I'd start thinking about chickening out and secure that seat.

We're going to have a party come May.
