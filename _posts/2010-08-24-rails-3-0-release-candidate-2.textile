The release candidate process is progressing as planned. This second candidate has very few changes over the first, which means that unless any blockers are discovered with this release, we're targeting the final release of Rails 3.0 for this week(!!!).

So please do help us weed out any blockers. Especially in our two new main dependencies: <a href="http://gembundler.com/v1.0/index.html">Bundler</a> and <a href="http://github.com/rails/arel">ARel</a>. They've both progressed into release candidacy for their 1.0 releases and will be sharing the same 1.0-final release date as Rails 3.0.

You can see a complete list of all the dotted t's and crossed i's on the new fabulous Github <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0_RC...v3.0.0_RC2">comparo view of RC1 and RC2</a>.

As always, you install this latest version with: <code>gem install rails --pre</code>

Also note that Rails 3.0 now has it's own <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/3-0-stable">stable branch</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">master branch</a> is now reserved for Rails 3.1 development. (That's right, we're already going there and it's going to be M-A-G-I-C-A-L!).
