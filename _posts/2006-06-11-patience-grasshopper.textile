We all know that for some time this blog has needed some love. Well at last it can be told: There's been a super-secret project underway for a while to upgrade the blog and get it running the way it should. We didn't want to make a huge deal of it, but it seems that a few overly enthusiastic readers _really_ enjoy posting bug reports as comments. So just chill out - the upgrade is coming soon. Posting thousands of comments isn't going to make it happen any faster.
