Dave Thomas has just announced that the first release-candidate of "Rails Recipes":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/ is now available. What that means is that the book is essentially in its finished form. It's had a great beta run, with a lot of praise and good feedback. Now that it's been put through its passes, it's pretty much ready for primetime, sporting 70 solutions to your real world programming challenges. If you've been holding off, now is a great time to get in on what is shaping up to be the de facto companion to "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/.

If you already bought the PDF, you can "get the latest copy for free":http://books.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/reorder.
