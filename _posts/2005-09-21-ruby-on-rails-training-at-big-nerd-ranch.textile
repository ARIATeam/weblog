The venerable Big Nerd Ranch have just announced that they're offering an intensive <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/ruby.shtml">5-day course in Ruby on Rails</a>. The man at the wheel is none other than Rails core member Marcel Molina. The Big Nerd Ranch package is definitely a treat that includes "...a student guide, a luxury room, three delicious meals a day, a stylish "Big Nerd Ranch" t-shirt, and transportation to and from the airport". All for a clean $3,500.

If you've been thinking about digging into Rails, but haven't had the time to get dedicated yet, this is the retreat for you.
