If you've been in the Ruby community for any time, you will likely have heard about "Domain Specific Languages". Rails uses the concept extensively with its macro style methods for setting up associations, callbacks and validations in models, as well as layouts and filters in controllers. Indeed, Ruby provides great support for creating your own DSLs. It may have become easier to spot domain specific languages, but how does one actually implement them? 

Rails core team member "Jamis Buck":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org has taken the time to guide you toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms used to create domain specific languages. Get up to speed with his tutorial, "Writing Domain Specific Languages":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/04/20/writing-domain-specific-languages, and you'll be creating elegant abstractions sooner rather than later. What a treat.
