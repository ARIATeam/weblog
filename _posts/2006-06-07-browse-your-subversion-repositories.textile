"Bounty Source":https://www.bountysource.com provides the Open Source community with free hosting and tools including a task manager, a CMS, and a Subversion Code Repository.  They've been gracious enough to release the "Subversion Browser":https://bssvnbrowser.bountysource.com/ as a Rails plugin.  

I've posted a "technique":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2006/5/31/adding_authentication_to_bssvnbrowser on "Rails Weenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net on using your application's authentication scheme on the plugin, so that your _secret sauce_ is not available to the whole world.
