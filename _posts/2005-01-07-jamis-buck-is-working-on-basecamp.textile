Along with the <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000386.html">announcement</a> of the latest major upgrade to <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, I've unveiled who the mysterious programmer we've brought on at 37signals is. So I thought I'd also wish him a warm welcome on landing a Rails-based job from the Rails weblog.

Congratulations on landing a contract working with Rails, <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> :)

You may recognize the name from his many contributions to the Ruby community. Most recently, the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/messages/a2b430cc4e29ebd6?thread_id=3ce6d81f49206cf1&mode=thread&noheader=1&q=comp.lang.ruby+sqlite3+jamis#doc_a2b430cc4e29ebd6">SQLite3 bindings</a> that's taking the dream of self-contained Rails applications a big step closer to reality.

*UPDATE:* Jamis shares a <a href="http://www.jamisbuck.org/jamis/blog.cgi/programming/The%20Cat's%20Out%20of%20the%20Bag_20050107085036.tx">few more details</a>.
