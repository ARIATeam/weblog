If you have trouble wrapping your head around assert_tag and its options, you might want to give CSS selectors a chance instead. There are currently two plugins for handling that: "assert_select":http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/07/03/assert_select-plugin-for-rails/ and "hpricot helper":http://www.fearoffish.co.uk/blog/article/testing_views_with_style.

The hpricot style gives you something like @assert element('title').should_contain('Funky Chicken Title')@ and the assert_select gives you something like @assert_select "title", "Welcome"@. 

From a brief cursory overview, I tend to like the assert_select style better. But I have yet to use either for real stuff. Please do shoot a comment with your experiences. One of these methods could well make it into core.
