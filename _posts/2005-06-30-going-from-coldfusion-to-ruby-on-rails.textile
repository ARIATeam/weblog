Michael Buffington from Adaptive Path <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2005/06/first_rails_app.html#more">talks about his experience</a> going from ColdFusion to Ruby on Rails. Here's a choice bit:

<blockquote>I'd say it took me less than 10 hours to build <a href="http://www.wordphoto.org/">wordPhoto.org</a>, which includes image uploads, thumbnail generation, email notifiers, a user login system, extensive data validation, clean urls, and various Ajax tidbits.
