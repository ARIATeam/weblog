Just a heads-up. Honey, the next application from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a>, is using a lot of <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax techniques</a> to get a spiffy and responsive interface. I'm already well underway in the process of refining the techniques and they're just about ripe for extraction into Rails. Before Rails go 1.0, it'll be the framework with the easiest support for Ajax on the block.
