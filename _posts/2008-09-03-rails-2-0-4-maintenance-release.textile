Thanks to Git it's been a lot easier to maintain older branches of the code base, so we've taken the opportunity to backport a bunch of bug fixes to the 2.0 branch and here's the release for that. 

The only major issue is that we've fixed the REXML DoS vulnerability with a monkey patch that ships in the box. So if you're on 2.0 and haven't dealt with the issue already, you can upgrade to 2.0.4 and get it fixed.

You can install with: <code>gem install rails --version 2.0.4</code>

<b>UPDATE:</b> The actual 2.0.4 gem didn't get published yesterday due to a bug in the release script. It's been fixed and 2.0.4 is actually available on the main gem repository. Sorry about that!
