Joao Pedrosa has been using both Rails and WebWork and iterates <a href="http://sinsalabintrix.blogspot.com/2005/01/motion-on-rails.html">five key points</a> on why "...WW is clearly inferior to Rails in every aspect" before arriving at the following conclusion:

<blockquote>Although I think RoR is superior to all Java web framework I used so far, I really respect the WW guys for building this framework which is one of the coolest in Javaland (unfortunately still ruled by crapware like Struts) but there is absolutely NO WAY any Java framework can compete with RoR... just try to build some real life app with it to figure out yourself how much precious time you've been wasting until now.<br/><br/>Time to shutdown IDEA and launch <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, 2005 will definetly be the year of Ruby on Rails! :)</blockquote>
