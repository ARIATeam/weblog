"SwitchTower":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/08/05/introducing-switchtower author "Jamis Buck":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/ has provided an "excellent manual":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17 documenting how to use it. Those who've taken the plunge are loving how easy it makes deployment, as well as myriad other tasks. But I'm still always hearing, "We haven't setup SwitchTower yet but are really looking forward to".

Enter "Rails Machine":http://railsmachine.com. It sets out to lower the barrier to using SwitchTower by taking care of all the setup and maintenance. They are scheduling to open their doors in April. For now take a look at the "short movie":http://railsmachine.com/screencasts/RailsMachineIntro.mov they've made showing how easy they've made it for you to get going with SwitchTower. They get you up and running in under 5 minutes. No more excuse to not realize how much you love SwitchTower.
