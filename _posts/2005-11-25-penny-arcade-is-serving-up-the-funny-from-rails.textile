<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> has been a personal long-time favorite, so I'm delighted to hear that their latest redesign features a backend that's entirely done in Rails. Woop. Gabe, who's obviously not the programmer behind the engine, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/11/14/">writes</a>:

<blockquote>Along with the slick new visuals the guts of the site also got a huge upgrade. Penny Arcade right now represents one of the largest implementations of "rails" on the intertron. I went and looked at a website about rails and then I got a headache. From what I gathered it&rsquo;s either some kind of cutting edge programming language, or a way to liquefy a man&rsquo;s brain inside his skull. I'm told that it means the site looks better and loads faster regardless of whatever hippy web browser you decide to use. Fuck M$!</blockquote>
