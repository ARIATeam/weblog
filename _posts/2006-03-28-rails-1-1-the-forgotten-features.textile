Today, Mike Clark follows the release of Rails 1.1 with: "Rails 1.1: The Forgotten Features":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/03/28#Rails11, a writeup of some of the _little_ changes in Rails 1.1 that, though not big enough to make the big list of "wow"s, are sure to make all Rails developers' lives a little better every day.

Take a look and feel free to suggest additions to the list if you've got 'em.
