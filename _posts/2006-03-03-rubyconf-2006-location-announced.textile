Hot on the heals of the fervor behind the upcoming "RailsConf":http://railsconf.org, the location of RubyConf 2006 has been announced. This fall it's going to be in Denver, Colorado from October 20-22, 2006. 

Two years ago we had about 70 people at RubyConf. This past year we stopped accepting signups months before the event when 200 tickets were sold. This year's conference promises to have huge demand. 

Venue, schedule and registration should be opening up in the Spring. Keep an eye on the "RubyConf site":http://www.rubyconf.org/ as more details trickle out.

Big thanks to "David Black":http://www.rubypowerandlight.com and the others behind "RubyCentral":http://rubycentral.org for their tireless work setting all this up.
