ActiveReload has just released "Warehouse":http://activereload.net/2007/7/9/warehouse-subversion-browser-released, a simple subversion browser written using Rails.  It sports a beautiful UI and can handle the mundane task of user and permission management for you.  It's also being distributed in a unique fashion for most Rails applications.  Instead of being hosted, it is sold and downloaded to be installed on your own server.

If you're interested, check us out at the "Warehouse site":http://warehouseapp.com/.
