The father of Java, James Gosling, is traveling the down under and has some.. erhm.. "interesting" thoughts on scripting languages. I'm getting these <a href="http://www.twelve71.org/blogs/alan/archives/000729.html">sound bytes</a> from Alan Fracis' summary of the Sidney meeting, so there is a chance they might not be accurate, but here they are:

<blockquote>Opinion of script languages - Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP<br/>
Program density and comprehensibility are inversely related<br/>
Write Once, Read Never. TECO was worse. Rapid Development<br/>
static typing gets you to prod faster, scripting gets you<br/>
to demo first. easy to write small things, harder to wrote 
big things.</blockquote>

Oy. First of all, lumping all these dynamic languages together under the convenient banner of "scripting" to attack them in symphony is disingenuous in itself. But claiming that writing a long program leads to a more comprehensible one is just plain silly. I hope that wasn't what he meant.

Additionally, the artificial distinction between "demo" and "prod" in a post-agile world rings awfully hollow in that High Priest of Architecture kind-of-way. Once more oy.
