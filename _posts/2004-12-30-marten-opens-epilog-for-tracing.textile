Alongside EliteJournal, Epilog is the other major weblog application development going on with Rails. Marten is set to release a new version running off the 0.9.x series of Rails in "...a week, two at most", but you can already Trac along as Marten just set up shop at "dev-epilog.standardbehaviour.com":http://dev-epilog.standardbehaviour.com/.

For a small taste of what's to come, <a href="http://www.markijbema.nl/blog/">Mark IJbema</a> is blogging using the in-development version of Epilog. Note the small promising details like human times in the form of "just after midnight". Promising stuff!
