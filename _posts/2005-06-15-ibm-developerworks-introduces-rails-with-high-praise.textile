<img src="http://www-136.ibm.com/i/t-l-f-rubycrossing.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px" />The top story on <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks">IBM developerWorks</a> is none other than <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-rubyrails/">Fast-track your Web apps with Ruby on Rails</a>. It's a very nice, quick overview by example of why "Ruby on Rails is taking Web development by storm", as David Mertz writes. He also has a particularly pleasing conclusion:

<blockquote>The best thing about Rails is that it fosters a whole "Rails way of thinking," since it comes complete with all the supporting code you need. This is a big plus over other toolkits and frameworks that just give raw materials to work with. Rails development offers you a clear path from a half-formed idea to a fully functioning Web application.</blockquote>

Those conventions are more than just a better solution to configuration, it's also a path through the jungle. Or a highway. Ah, no. A rail road. Yes, a rail road.
