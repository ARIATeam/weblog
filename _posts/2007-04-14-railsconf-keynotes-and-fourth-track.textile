We're putting the finishing touches on the "RailsConf 2007":http://railsconf.org schedule this week.  Given the huge number of high quality proposals (well over 3 times the number from last year), we're working on putting together a fourth track.

We have also finalized an exciting lineup of keynote speakers for the conference.  I was frankly a bit worried about the keynote lineup as we started initial planning of RailsConf 2007.  "Last year's":http://2006.railsconf.org keynotes were going to be hard to live up to.  My fears were ill-founded.  We ended up with a program to be really excited about.

The RailsConf program promises to be thought-provoking, trend-starting, entertaining, tone-setting, and, most of all, fun.

See you in May!
