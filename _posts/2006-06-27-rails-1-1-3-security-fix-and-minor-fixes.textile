We've found and fixed a security issue with routing that could cause excess CPU usage in Rails processes when triggered by certain URLs. We strongly encourage anyone running 1.1.x to upgrade to the latest version. It's fully backwards compatible and should serve as a small drop-in fix.

If you're running the latest Edge Rails, though, there's no need to update. We've rewritten the routes functionality on edge and the new version doesn't have this problem.

To upgrade, you as always can just do: <code>gem install rails --include-dependencies</code>

Note: This release doesn't include any of the new CRUD/resource-based features. All of the new features we've been working on over the last couple of months will become available in 1.2.0, which is scheduled for "soonish". This 1.1.3 release is purely to address the security issue and another few minor fixes that were available on the STABLE branch as well.
