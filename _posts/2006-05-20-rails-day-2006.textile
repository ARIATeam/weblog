Last June was the first Rails Day, where teams of two or three competed to build the best all around Rails app in a 24 hour period.

Well they're doing it again this year: "Rails Day 2006":http://www.railsday2006.com/ will be held on June 17th, just a few days before the first official "Rails Conference":http://railsconf.org.

Last year's contest had dozens of dozens of teams and almost as many prizes, including some pretty sweet ones for the teams that won top honors. 

This year's organizers are "looking for your help on fine tuning the rules":http://www.railsday2006.com/articles/2006/05/20/help-us-tweak-the-rules. So weigh in with your opinions if you have any.

"Registration":http://www.railsday2006.com/pages/register/ isn't quite open yet. So rally the troops and stay tuned.
