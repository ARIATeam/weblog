I'm only a week behind on the "release of Typo 4":http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/07/22/typo-4-0-0.  Typo is one of the oldest and most visible of Rails open source projects, so it's always nice to see a new release.  Out of all the new features and bug fixes, what really stood out for me was the Typo installer.  Scott has recently extracted this into "its own gem":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rails-installer/, ready for inclusion with your own Rails applications!

bq. Typo now includes a .gem-based installer that makes it easy to install Typo. Just install the Typo gem (gem install typo) and run the Typo installer (typo install /some/path) to create a new Typo blog in /some/path. The installer will install all of Typo’s files, create a working set of config files, create a SQLite database for you, and start the Mongrel web server on a random TCP port. It’ll also create a set of sample Apache and Lighttpd configuration files to show you how to tie Typo into your existing web server. -- "Typo Installer":http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/07/23/typo-installer
