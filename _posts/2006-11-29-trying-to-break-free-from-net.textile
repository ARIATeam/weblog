"Luckymonk":http://luckymonk.com/ escaped their .NET entanglement and found Ruby on Rails, but they still have to live in a Windows world. Now they're putting on "a workshop":http://workshop.softiesonrails.com/ teaching you how to do the same. It's in Chicago and it's almost sold out.

Usually we don't mention workshops any more (there are so many), but I thought it would be nice to shine some light on one of the lesser published transitions. The one from .NET to Ruby on Rails. We got plenty of stories of how PHP and Java folks are jumping ship, so its great to hear how it's happening from the Microsoft camp too.
