Editor Andreas Ahlenstorf would like to print an article on Rails in the Swiss IT magazine InfoWeek:

<blockquote>I'm looking for somebody who would like to write an article about
Ruby on Rails for the swiss IT magazine InfoWeek, best one of Rails'
core developers :). The article must be written in german, so it
would be helpful if it's somebody from Switzerland, Germany or even
Austria. Do you know one person in your team who's predestinated to
do that?</blockquote>

Do you know Rails? And can write a readable German? Then get in <a href="mailto:rails-iw@sopic.com">contact with Andreas</a> right away and help him increase the awareness of Ruby on Rails in Switzerland.
