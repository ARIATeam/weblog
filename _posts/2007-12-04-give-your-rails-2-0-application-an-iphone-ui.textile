Multi-view development is a big deal in Rails 2.0. We've made it much simpler to allow the same action to serve many different formats. From HTML to XML to JSON to RSS and ATOM to CSV to whatever. 

But did you know that you can use the same multi-view system to trout out different flavors of the same basic types? Say, give iPhone users a custom HTML interface while serving regular HTML users with the standard feast.

Slash Dot Dash teaches you how to do exactly that: <a href="http://www.slashdotdash.net/articles/2007/12/04/iphone-on-rails-creating-an-iphone-optimised-version-of-your-rails-site-using-iui-and-rails-2">Give a Rails 2.0 application an iPhone UI</a>.
