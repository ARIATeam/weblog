Eric Mill went ahead and created "Jester":http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/4/2/jester-javascriptian-rest, a library that lets you manipulate your Rails-style resources with javascript models.  I think it's great that we're seeing implementations in other languages.  This "python port of Routes":http://routes.groovie.org/index.html implements map.resources, can a python port of ActiveResource be far behind?
