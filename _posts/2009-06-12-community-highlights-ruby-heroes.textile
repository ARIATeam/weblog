This week I'm happy to tell you about a new set of articles which will be appearing here on the Rails blog called "Community Highlights".  This new series will feature people/projects/sites from the Rails community that may deserve a little extra recognition.

This week, we're going to start with a few people who received awards on stage at Railsconf 2009, this years Ruby Heroes. 

*Brian Helmkamp*

<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Brian has been a contributing member of the Ruby community for 4 years now, but is most well known for his testing library "Webrat":http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master/.  He's a contributer to Rails, RSpec, Rubinius, and is a co-author on the recent "RSpec Book":http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book.  More recently he’s been helping out the Rails core team with Rack:Test, and Rack:Debug.

<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Aman has taken over the maintenance, new features, and the recent releases of "EventMachine":http://rubyeventmachine.com/, which is an invaluable tool for writing fast ruby applications. He’s also the author behind "amqp":http://github.com/tmm1/amqp/tree & "xmpp4em":http://github.com/tmm1/xmpp4em/tree gems which are deployed far and wide.

<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Luis has done a lot for the Ruby community in Argentina, but he’s most well known in our community for the work he’s done for windows users maintaining the "One-Click Ruby Installer":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/.  Recently he's put up a "Plegie":http://pledgie.com/campaigns/4435 to help get the windows installer a new home.

*Pat Allan*

<img src="/assets/2009/6/12/Pat-Allan.png" style="float:left" />
<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Pat is the mastermind behind "Thinking Sphinx":http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/ which has become a standard when it comes to full-text search in Rails.  He is also the author of the excellent "Thinking Sphinx":http://peepcode.com/products/thinking-sphinx-pdf PDF book and one of the founders of "Railscamp":http://railscamp08.org/, where I hear he makes some killer pancakes.

*Dan Kubb*

<img src="/assets/2009/6/12/DanKubb.png" style="float:left" />
<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Dan been tirelessly working on one of the hardest Ruby projects around, "DataMapper":http://datamapper.org/doku.php.  He became the official maintainer after Sam Smoot and since then has completely rewritten the test suite to give DataMapper better coverage, has come up with a viable path to completion, and is currently working on making sure DataMapper works great with Rails 3.

*John Nunemaker*

<img src="/assets/2009/6/12/JohnNunemaker.png" style="float:left" />
<div style="font-size: 0.9em">Although John Nunemaker has released several widely used open source libraries, like "HTTParty":http://httparty.rubyforge.org/ and "HappyMapper":http://happymapper.rubyforge.org/, his main contribution in my opinion comes from his blog "Rails Tips":http://railstips.org/.  Over the past year he's written an incredible number "educational blog posts":http://railstips.org/smorgasbord/ on many Ruby and Rails topics.
