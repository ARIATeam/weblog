A List A Part is featuring a special issue dedicated to Ruby on Rails. There's <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/creatingmoreusinglesseffortwithrubyonrails">Creating More Using Less Effort with Ruby on Rails</a> by Michael Slater and <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/gettingstartedwithrubyonrails">Getting Started with Ruby on Rails</a> by Dan Benjamin. Both articles serve as great introduction to what all the hoopla is about. Great stuff to forward to friends who might be interested, but still haven't made the jump.
