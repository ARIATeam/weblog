Rails 2.1.1 is another maintenance release that includes a bunch of bug fixes and a fix for "the REXML vulnerability":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/8/23/dos-vulnerabilities-in-rexml. I've extracted all the "changes from the CHANGELOGs into a single Gist":http://gist.github.com/8946. Enjoy!

To install, just do: <code>gem install rails --version 2.1.1</code>.

Next upcoming release will be Rails 2.2 beta which is quite close.
