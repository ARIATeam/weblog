Justin French have survived the first week on his <a href="http://justinfrench.com/index.php?id=91">transitionary journey</a> from PHP to Rails. I have special sympathy for refugees from that camp as I used to do a lot of PHP myself not too long ago. Justin sums up his experience with:

<blockquote>I also think that a Rails developer is inherently a &ldquo;better&rdquo; programmer by force. PHP makes it very easy for anyone (myself included) to slap together some poorly planned procedural code and claim the title of &ldquo;PHP Web Application Developer&rdquo;. Rails on the other hand at least tries to make us better programmers by default.</blockquote>

It's certainly possible to write PHP that doesn't succumb to the draw of becoming a big ball of mud, but the structure is completely self-imposed. Easy to slip if you're not careful.

Seems like Justin has quite a following of <a href="http://justinfrench.com/?id=90">other PHP'ers curious about Rails</a>, so its great to see that he's continuing to blog the transition and hopefully instill others with the courage to do the same.
