Greg from Social Twister <a href="http://socialtwister.com/archives/000548.html">wants to hire Ruby on Rails developers</a> to help the company move various Cold Fusion applications to their new platform. Greg writes about CF vs RoR:

<blockquote>For my fellow CFers out there, I'll simply say that I still love CF, but Rails Rocks. My CF code was written very similar to the way Rails works now so it made a lot of sense. We're planning to open source at least one major part of our system and that's going to require something that's freely available unfortunately.</blockquote>
