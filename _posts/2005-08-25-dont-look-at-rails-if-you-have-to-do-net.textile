Sam gives <a href="http://srsmoot.blogspot.com/2005/08/jaajax-and-state-of-ajax-on-net.html">a word of caution to fellow .NET developers</a> regarding Ruby on Rails:

<blockquote> Once you write an application in MonoRail you'll never want to go back to regular ASP.NET. Just don't look at Ruby On Rails. As I read on another blog: If you haven't by this point, then don't. It may lead to depression, despair, etc when you realize you've been writing two or three times as much code as you needed to get the job done, and Rails makes anything else look like spaghetti code no matter how clean it is. :D</blockquote>
