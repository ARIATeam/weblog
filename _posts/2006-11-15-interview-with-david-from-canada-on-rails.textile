Better late than never, the InfoQ team has finally released an "interview done with yours truly":http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson back in April at Canada on Rails. It includes questions like "How long until you are the vendor?" and "WS-* is that bullshit?" and many more fun themes. The questioner is "Obie Fernandez":http://www.jroller.com/page/obie.
