And once again, "hackfest":http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org is back. Only this time, it's better than ever, thanks to "Git":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-git

The idea is quite simple. You get 5000 points for each of your patches that get merged to the "core":http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master. The person with the highest points at the end of the month wins.

"August hackfest":http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/2008/8 is already on and almost 3 more weeks to go, so hack on for the first prize - a free pass to "RailsConf Europe":http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/content/home ( special thanks goes to O'Reilly for the prize )

If you've never contributed to Rails before, now is a good time. "This railscast":http://railscasts.com/episodes/113 is a nice head start.

Thanks to all those who have contributed to Rails, making it better and better.
