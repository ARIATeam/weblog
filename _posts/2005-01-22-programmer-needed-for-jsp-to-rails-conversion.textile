Gately's would like to dump their <a href="http://www.gatelys.com/">JSP-powered shop</a> and upgrade to Rails. They're looking for Rails talent to help them do just that:

<blockquote>We need a developer who is proficient in (and hates) JSP for a contract-to-hire position which would involve replacing a JSP app with a Rails app for a growing e-tailer in the Denver, CO area. Would prefer local talent, but would consider teleworkers from anywhere with the right skills. Please contact me (Solomon White, solo [at] gatelys [dotcom]) if you feel you might be a fit.</blockquote>
