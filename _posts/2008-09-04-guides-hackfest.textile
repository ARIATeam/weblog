I'm pleased to finally announce the "Rails Guides Hackfests":http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/guide. And we got really exciting prizes too! There is a list of guides available at "Lighthouse":http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/16213-rails-guides/tickets?q=state%3Aopen You can select one of those, update the ticket and start writing the guide straight away. 

For each completed guide, the author will receive all of the following prizes :

*  $200 from "Caboose Rails Documentation Project":http://pledgie.org/campaigns/34
* 1 year of "GitHub Micro account":http://github.com/plans
