It's my pleasure to announce that Santiago Pastorino has joined <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">the Rails Core group</a>. Santiago only started contributing to Rails this year, but has been on fire ever since his first patches were accepted. He's managed to rack up <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/santiago-pastorino/commits">380 commits since the beginning of the year</a>.

Santiago is one of the lead developers and co-founder of <a href="http://www.wyeworks.com/">WyeWorks</a> from Montevideo, Uruguay. He started working full-time with Ruby and Rails in the middle of 2008 after years of Java development. Since early 2010 he is trying to work full-time on OSS and sporadically writes on <a href="http://blog.wyeworks.com/">his company's blog</a>.

Congratulations!
