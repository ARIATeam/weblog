We've reviewed, committed, and scored the patch flood. Congratulations to our "twenty RailsConf 2007 Hackfest winners":http://workingwithrails.com/contests/hackfest2007/winners. Truly, a crack team of Rails commandos.

Over 24 days, we saw 263 participants open 462 tickets, submit 527 patches, and make 3169 comments. Great show, all -- see you at "RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails!
