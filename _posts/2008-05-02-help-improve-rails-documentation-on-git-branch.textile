Pratik's documentation branch for Rails has moved to <a href="http://github.com/lifo/docrails">http://github.com/lifo/docrails</a>. This branch is open for all to contribute to directly. Just send Pratik a note on Github asking for access and it shall be granted. There's even a page for <a href="http://github.com/lifo/docrails/wikis">the conventions used on the branch</a>.

This makes it easier than ever to help improve the documentation for Rails and harder than ever to just sit back and whine about it. Make something great!
