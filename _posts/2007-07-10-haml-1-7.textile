The "Haml":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/ team recently announced the release of "Haml 1.7":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/release-notes, which is an alternative markup system that you can use in Rails, instead of the default ERb-based markup. Version 1.7 is significantly faster than previous releases (and is almost as fast as Rails' default system, now!). There are a few other new features, too: "read all about it in the release notes":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/release-notes. Great work!
