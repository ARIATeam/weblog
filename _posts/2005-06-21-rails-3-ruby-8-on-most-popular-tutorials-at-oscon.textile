<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6356">Ruby on Rails: Enjoying the Ride of Programming</a>, the tutorial I'm giving at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005">OSCON</a>, is the third most popular tutorial for the entire conference! As Nathan Torkington from O'Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/06/oscon_top_tutor.html">writes</a>: "Tutorial signups for OSCON are a great measure of what's hot in Open Source." Rails most surely be hitting the hot still.

And it's not only Rails. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6706">Dave Thomas' Ruby tutorial</a> is #8 on the same list! It's going to be a fantastic conference for Ruby on Rails. And I'm not only saying that because I'm doing a keynote, a session talk, and this tutorial on the subject. Not at all. Really.
