Rick Olson is getting jiggy with Active Resource these days and decided to spread the love with a "brief introduction":http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2006/12/13/taking-ares-out-for-a-test-drive to the newest member of the Rails framework family. He takes you through how to use ARes as a client for the Beast forum in a few simple steps. Get your REST face on and enjoy.
