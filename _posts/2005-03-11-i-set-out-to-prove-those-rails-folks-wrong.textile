Steven R. Baker was "...depressed by web development", but he also pretty sure that "...sophisticated applications wouldn&rsquo;t be any easier to build with Rails". So what did he do? He <a href="http://blog.lavalamp.ca/articles/read/2">gave it a try</a>:

<blockquote>So I did what any self-respecting skeptic would do: I set out to prove those Rails folks wrong. I was asked to write a web application for customer and work order management. I decided that this would be a good chance to learn Rails, and prove those Rails folks wrong. Rolling with Ruby on Rails told me that I would write web applications ten times faster using Rails. I prepared a schedule as though I was writing the app with PHP, and quoted my client one quarter of the estimated time (three weeks). In the space of that three weeks I went from having not written a line of Ruby outside of text book examples, to developing a fully functioning (and mostly tested) Rails application for a client.</blockquote>

The borg is at work. Baker finishes off with:

<blockquote>In mid January, I set out to prove those rails folks wrong. Now I&rsquo;m one of them. Prove me wrong.</blockquote>
