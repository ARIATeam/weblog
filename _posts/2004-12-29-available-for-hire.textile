I'm regularly getting requests from people who wants to start up Rails development, but are looking for a way to kick-start the affair by retaining one or more experts. Some make good candidates for referring to the firms listing themselves on the "Commercial Support":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/CommercialSupport page while others are looking to hire developers into their team on either a contract or full-time basis.

It's for the latter scenario that I've started the "Available for Hire":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/AvailableForHire page on the wiki. If you're a single developer looking for work with Ruby, please do add yourself to that page if you feel your skill set is at a level where you could consider yourself "capable" with Rails.

Defining "capable" is always hard, but you should probably at least have made significant contributions to the framework and/or have one or more Rails projects under your belt. Such a project can very well be a demo application, though. It needs not be commercial work.
