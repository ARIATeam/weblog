Computerworld is pinning "Rails as the #1 technology to know in 2007":http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9011969&intsrc=hm_ts_head. As the only piece of software among group of hardware including NAND drives and new CPUs. About Rails they write:

<blockquote><i>Equal parts design philosophy and development environment, Rails offers developers a few key code-level advantages when constructing database-backed Web applications. One of the central tenets emphasizes using less code for application development by avoiding redundancy and following Rails conventions. This means increased performance and, ideally, decreased development times.</i></blockquote>
