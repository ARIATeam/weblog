<img src="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/assets/2006/9/7/adobe_logo.gif" align="right" border="0" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" />Adobe's Mike Potter brings "the cherry news":http://blogs.adobe.com/mikepotter/2006/09/announcing_the_1.html that an "officially-backed Rails SDK for Flex":http://code.google.com/p/rubyonrails-ria-sdk-by-adobe/ and the rest of the company's RIA suite is now available.

Derek Wischusen from "Flex on Rails":http://flexonrails.net/ gives us "the scoop on its content":http://flexonrails.net/?p=12:

<blockquote><i>Currently, the SDK contains a sample demonstrating: (1) Intergrating with a database, basic CRUD, and rails migrations. (2) Uploading and downloading files. (3) Downloading data directly from Flex and sending data to a new browser window directly from Flex. (4) a simple Directory Explorer.  The last sample uses WebORB for integrating Flex with Rails.</i></blockquote>

Great news. Flash is on the fast track out its ghetto image and its exciting to see Adobe care about integration with the world around it.
