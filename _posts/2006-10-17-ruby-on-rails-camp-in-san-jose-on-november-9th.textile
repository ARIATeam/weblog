"Ruby on Rails Camp":http://www.rubyonrailscamp.com/ is an event for up to 120 people who can make it out to the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose and are willing to cough up $25 for the entry. Their pitch is:

<blockquote>Ruby on Rails Camp will be a gathering of enthusiasts who want to share and learn more about Ruby on Rails (RoR) in an open environment. It will be an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants.</blockquote>

The focus is the somewhat odd question "Is Ruby on Rails Ready for Business?", but that shouldn't stop you from going if you're in the area.
