"Chad Fowler's":http://chadfowler.com excellent "Rails Recipes":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/, quickly becoming the de facto companion to the canonical "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/, is out of beta and off to the printers. Now that you, the community, put it through its beta paces, it's been cleaned up and deemed ready for prime time. If you've been holding off til now, your time has come: "order it here":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/.

For those who couldn't wait and jumped on board during the beta, you can get a "free update here":http://books.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/reorder.

A big thanks to Chad for the months of work he's put into this.
