Justin Gehtland and Stuart Halloway has been moving along at a rapid pace on "Streamlined":http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/ since its unveiling at RailsConf in June. There's now a "public repository":http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/08/11/anonymous-svn-available with the code available and they've put together a "convincing screencast":http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/08/02/screencast-available of its use.

I really like their approach of using separate UI classes instead of contaminating the model classes with administrative concerns. It has a great feel and look to it. Exciting to see it move forward.
