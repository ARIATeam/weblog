In <a href="http://www.carpeaqua.com/archives/2004/12/23/2004_computing_in_review.php">2004 Computing In Review</a>, Justin Williams proclaims Ruby on Rails to be his Technology of the Year #1:

<blockquote>"Without a doubt, the most fun I have had programming in the past few months has been with Ruby on Rails. While the majority of my year was dominated with Cocoa stuff at work, I have been working almost exclusively in Rails for the past few."</blockquote>

As #2, Justin likes TypeKey for cutting his comment spams from 30/day to zero, and as #3 enters RSS.
