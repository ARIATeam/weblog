"RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ has sold close to three quarters of the available seats for the May 17-20 show at an amazing rate. It's only been a week since we opened for registrations. So it's naturally wonderful to see that level of excitement even as our venue this year can accommodate a ton more people than last year. This certainly looks like it'll be another sold out RailsConf shortly.

And hot on the heels of RailsConf in Portland, we've just opened up the Request for Proposals for "RailsConf Europe":http://www.railsconfeurope.com/, which will take place in Berlin between September 17-19. Last year RailsConf EU was a bit more of a sleeper hit than the Chicago show, but turned out absolutely fantastic with loads of exclusive and all-new content. With Berlin being a significantly cheaper city than London and part of mainland Europe, we'll no doubt have an even greater show.

So "get your proposals ready":http://www.railsconfeurope.com/cs/railseurope2007/create/e_sess for RailsConf Europe. And if you haven't already, snatch one of the last seats for RailsConf in Portland.
