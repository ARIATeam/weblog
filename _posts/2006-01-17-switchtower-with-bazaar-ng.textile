Damien Merenne has just announced a "Bazaar-NG SCM module for SwitchTower":http://www.cosinux.org/blogs/dam/articles/2006/01/17/bazaar-ng-and-switchtower. All you bzr users now have one less reason to _not_ use SwitchTower.

Damien has given permission for this module to be included in the next SwitchTower release, too. If you've got a pet SCM that you'd like to see supported by SwitchTower, just take a look at Damien's code to see how little it really takes to implement a new SCM module. Then, implement it and submit it as a patch to http://dev.rubyonrails.org/newticket.
