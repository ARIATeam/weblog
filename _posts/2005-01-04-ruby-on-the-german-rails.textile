I love picking up <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftheflow.de%2Farchives%2F2005%2F01%2F03%2Fruby-on-rails&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools">Rails praise in a foreign language</a> through the wonder that is Google Translate:

<blockquote>...within fewer days it was my small Webapp finished and I a realization enrich: I like Python still rather than Ruby, but Rails rockt without end!

And even if David evangelisiert sometimes somewhat too much , then he is right nevertheless nearly always :)

Because with Ruby on Rails I had to have developed first time fun a Web application and to have written also the feeling somewhat elegant and none dirty PHP chopping.</blockquote>

Thanks for the kind words, Florian Munz. I apologies for publishing your words in a much "gebrochen" English. If you're fluent in the language of commands, you'd probably prefer the <a href="http://theflow.de/archives/2005/01/03/ruby-on-rails">un-mangled German original</a>.

*UPDATE:* <a href="http://www.mornography.de/2005/01/04/rails-is-teh-sup0r/">More German praise</a> from Mornography: "Ich hab&rsquo; Spa&szlig;".
