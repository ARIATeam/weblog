One of the measures of the health of a development platform is its ability to support a vibrant ecosystem of users, contributors, speakers, and authors. By this measure, Rails remains in excellent shape. The latest evidence: the release of the first issue of "Rails Magazine":http://railsmagazine.com/ - 36 pages of full-color glossy print.

The first issue includes 9 articles covering everything from delegation in Ruby to using Saasy for subscription-based applications to performance analysis and getting started with JRuby. The full content will be available on the web shortly, but if you'd like to support this effort (and help ensure that it doesn't go away) you can "order a paper copy":http://magcloud.com/browse/Issue/7830 for $8 in the US, UK, or Canada.
