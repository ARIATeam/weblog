Today someone on the Rails mailing list asked, innocently enough, "Is there by any chance some document available summarizing all the
(major) beautiful new stuff in Rails 1.1?" As is to be expected, he received instructions on how to do a diff between the 1.0 release tag and trunk as well as links to the CHANGELOGS. He used "summarize" carefully. Turns out there was nothing like he was looking for. Well, not for long...

"Scott Raymond":http://scottraymond.net, of "Blinksale":http://www.blinksale.com/ and "IconBuffet":http://iconbuffet.com/ fame, rolled up his sleeves and did the dirty work for the rest of us. So, as requested, here is "a summary of what will be new in Rails 1.1":http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/02/28/rails-1.1. Thanks Scott.
