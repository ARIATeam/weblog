Tim O'Reilly opened the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">Emerging Technology</a> conference today with a talk on pattern remixes. Much to our delight, Tim choose to highlight Ruby on Rails during the talk. I don't have much specifics outside of what few notes the blogosphere has jotted down, but <a href="http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/03/etech_tim_oreil.html">Jeff Clavier blogged the quote</a> as: "Ruby on Rails: being able to develop real-world applications with simple design and almost no code." Not a bad summary.

If you're at ETech, don't forget to check out Jason Fried's presentation, which follows the form of <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000423.html">the one he gave a few days ago</a> with great success at SXSW.
