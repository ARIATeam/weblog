Of late the ActiveRecord association code has been getting a lot of love. One of the high profile additions are polymorphic associations which turned into one of the big features of the 1.1 release. Amongst all the commotion, some may not have noticed that there is an enhanced way to do many to many associations other than with @has_and_belongs_to_many@. 

For some time people have been skipping out on @has_and_belongs_to_many@ in favor of setting up two @has_many@ associations so that they get the benefits of a full join model and what that brings with it. With 1.1's new @:through@ association option, a two way @has_many@ just got even sweeter. So if there are two ways to do a many to many relationship, what are the differences, and which approach should you take?
