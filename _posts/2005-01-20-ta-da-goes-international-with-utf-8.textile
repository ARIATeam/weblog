One of the simplest ways to make your application more welcoming to non-English speakers is to allow them the right of the native language. Before UTF-8 that was a huge mess of encoding types, but now all it takes is one line. One single meta setting and you can allow for:

The magic string is:

<notextile><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;</code></notextile>
