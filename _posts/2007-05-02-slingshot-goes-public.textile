Joyent's "Slingshot technology":http://developers.joyent.com/ for creating offline-capable Rails applications has gone public. They're even doing a "competition to celebrate":http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/SlingshotPortContest: The best ports of various open source Rails applications can win a 1-year big Accelerator ($1250 value). Now there's a project you can hack on the plane to Portland in a few weeks ;).
