Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails 4.1.2.rc1. This is the first bug fix release for
the 4.1 serie. Also, we are releasing a new bug fix release for the 4.0 serie, 4.0.6.rc1.

If no regressions are found we will release the final this Monday, on May 26, 2014.
If you find one, please open an Issue on GitHub and mention me (@rafaelfranca) on it,
so that we can fix it before the final release.
