"Bruce Williams":http://codefluency.com has started a new article series he calls "Rails Views":http://codefluency.com/articles/2006/05/27/introducing-rails-views.  Bruce is a long-time Rubyist and Rails early adopter and is the UI lead on development of a very large and complex Rails system.  If it's Rails and UI-related, Bruce is the man.  

Now he's chosen to share some of his Rails UI wisdom with the rest of us.  If you're doing complex user interface work in Rails, "check it out":http://codefluency.com/articles/tag/railsviews.
