"Kevin Clark":http://glu.ttono.us/ has written up "Rails for designers":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/21/rails-for-designers, an intro to Rails directed at designers which focuses on the parts and concepts of the framework that are of most immediate relevance to a designer. The tutorial gets designers oriented and ready to find, edit and use an application's templates. From layouts, to ERb, to partials and instance variables, this tutorial will get designers up and running in no time. If you are thinking of doing a Rails project, you could do a lot worse than having your designers start with this tutorial. Thanks for the primer Kevin.
