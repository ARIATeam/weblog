h3. March 28, 2009 - April 3, 2009

Things are still fairly quiet out on the edge: 5 commits this week. The work for Rails 3.0 hasn't been merged back to the master branch yet, so if you need any of the post-2.3 patches you can still just update to edge without worrying about major upheaval.

<b>Changes</b><br />

* When are 24 hours not 24 hours? When you add them across a DST boundary in Rails - at least, until one of this week's "commits":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5a8b481f717470b952ac7eb890f260ea98428153. You can read more details of what was going on over at the "Lighthouse ticket":https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2066.
* Looked at your development mode /rails/info/properties view lately? Look again after "this commit":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cad3e8b261a8d9551bc19a57007acf574d957548 and it will show all of the installed Rack middleware pieces in your application.
