Scott Barron is <a href="http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/articles/2005/08/19/rcss-anyone">toying with the idea of a rcss format</a> that would allow you to specify your CSS file in Ruby. Why would you ever want to do that? Have a look at <a href="http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/pages/rcss">Scott's example</a> and note the use of variables. That's a pretty good reason on its own.
