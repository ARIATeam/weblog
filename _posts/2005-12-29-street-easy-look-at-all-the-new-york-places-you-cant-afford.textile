<a href="http://www.streeteasy.com/">Street Easy</a> is a sweet new mash-up of Google Maps that's running Ruby on Rails to mock you for all the places in New York you can't afford to buy. Yet. Before you've launched <i>your</i> Web 2.0 mash-up and sold it to Yahoo. Wait a minute. It's RECURSIVE!

Kidding aside, this is a very nice looking site done by Sebastian Delmont and friends. Check it out.
