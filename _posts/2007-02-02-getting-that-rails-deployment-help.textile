As hosts start expanding their hosting options, it's becoming more important for folks to get together and share their deployment knowledge and trade war stories.  "Robby Russell thought it was time":http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/01/23/announcement-new-ruby-on-rails-deployment-group, and started a "rails-deployment":http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-deployment Google Group, as well as #rails-deployment on Freenode.  In just a short time, it's already attracted nearly 400 members, including experts from some prominent rails hosts like "PLANET ARGON":http://planetargon.com/, "Engine Yard":http://engineyard.com, and "Rails Machine":http://railsmachine.com.
