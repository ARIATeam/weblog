For those of you in the Silicon Valley, Zachary Taylor and others are starting up a Ruby on Rails group and are looking for people interested in joining in. They don't have any set dates for the first meeting, but are aiming for a get together in the coming weeks. If you are interested, "get involved":http://ruby.meetup.com/72/t/if_2829382/?gj=ej4.

If you are closer to San Francisco proper, you should know that they already have a group setup. The "SF Ruby Meetup":http://ruby.meetup.com/6/  has regular meetings on the 2nd Tuesday of the month.
