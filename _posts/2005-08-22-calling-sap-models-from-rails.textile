SAP is one of the ERP behemoths that dominates in the enterprise world. Pretty far removed from Rails? Not really, it turns out. Piers Harding has written a great <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/2111">article for the SAP Developer Network</a> that shows how to create a Rails application that uses a SAP backend as the model instead of Active Record.

The article shows how to use SAP4Rails with two BAPI objects - Currency (BUS1090), and ExchangeRate (BUS1093) - and make those available through a standard Action Controller setup. Very cool stuff.
