Thanks to Jim Freeze and Bill Kleb, we have excellent <a href="http://yhrhosting.com:7000/">audio recordings of all the RubyConf talks</a>. Together with the slides, you can at least get the sense of being there. And of course realize that RubyConf '06 (and RailsConf '06?) is something you can not miss.
