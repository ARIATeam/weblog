The Phusion team keeps blazing ahead with "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ and improving it rapidly. They've just "released version 2.0.5":http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/05/phusion-passenger-205-released-mentioned-on-live37signalscom/, which includes a few fixes and introduces compatibility with the Rack-based Edge Rails.

At 37signals, we've already switched over "Ta-da List":http://www.tadalist.com/ and are busy working on getting the rest of our suite running on Passenger. It's just so much easier to deal with and the memory savings you get through "REE":http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/ are a nice cherry on top.

I keep getting a steady stream of success reports from all over the world as well. I've even read of a few people getting back into Rails development because Passenger finally took out the inconvenience of deploying.

It's hard to argue with the usability. I've personally been setting up a new server running Ubuntu 8.10 and using Apache 2 with Passenger. The time it took me to go from a fresh install to a complete production setup was ridiculously low. There's just so much less to worry about.

If you haven't given Passenger a chance yet, now is definitely the time.
