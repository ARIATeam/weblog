Registration for <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe 2007</a> has opened up. It's all going down in Berlin, Germany from September 17th through 19th. There's a <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/sessions.html">ton of great speakers</a> lined up, so we'll undoubtedly have one heck of a party there. Really hope to see as many as possible there.
