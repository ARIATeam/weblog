The Rails <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/HomePage">wiki</a> has taken a few beatings, but now it's running in high class with proper rollback protection, so we should now have a stable host to fill with content. So what better place to start than to extract all the missing content from the two backups we have that might contain missing pages:

* "Static backup of changes from late November to late December":http://www.37signals.com/rails/wiki/HomePage.html
* "Dynamic backup that might contain missing pages in the latest move":http://lists.rubyonrails.org:2750/rails/show/HomePage

The easiest way to figure out what's missing is to go look for your own content. If you miss some of that, then please do retrieve it from one of the backups. But that shouldn't hold enterprising individuals back that want to help with the restoration. Dig in!
