"Jim Weirich":http://onestepback.org/ has been using Ruby for ages. He's one of the early-adopter all-stars from the days before Rails. Rails programmers will be familiar with his wildly popular and influencial "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ and "Builder":http://builder.rubyforge.org/ projects. He's also one of the main developers of "RubyGems":http://docs.rubygems.org/, which is scheduled to be included with Ruby in an upcoming release. 
 
The enthusiasm he brings to his work and talking about his work make it clear that he has a genuine love for programming. On top of it all, cliches aside, he's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. 

So what a treat to have him on the 
"Ruby on Rails podcast":http://podcast.rubyonrails.com/. "Have a listen":http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Jim-Weirich.m4a.

Cheers to "Geoffrey Grosenbach":http://topfunky.com/ for snagging yet another great guest.
