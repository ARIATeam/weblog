The latest "Rails podcast":http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/ features "Tom Copeland":http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/, one of the guys who generously runs "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/. Some might be surprised to know that "Rich Kilmer":http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ and Tom Copeland have been running RubyForge out of Rich's basement for the past few years.

Aside from keeping all our Ruby libraries available for download, Rich and Tom have  been putting in a lot of work on their latest application, "indi":http://www.getindi.com/ which is in  a private beta until mid summer.

Download the podcast: "mp3":http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Tom-Copeland.mp3, "mp4":http://paranode.com/~topfunky/audio/2006/Tom-Copeland.m4a.

A typed transcript should be available soon as well. For those interested in typed transcripts, you can subscribe to a "transcript RSS feed":http://feeds.feedburner.com/rubyonrails_transcript.
