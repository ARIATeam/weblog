Rails 3.0 is a gift from all of us who've worked on it to anyone who wants to build something. If you like our gift, please show it by donating to the Rails 3.0 release charity: Charity:Water. We've started a campaign to raise $100,000 in the name of Rails 3.0, which will give 5,000 people access to clean water if we make it.

Charity:Water is a fantastic charity (and not just because they run on Rails!). You'd make everyone working on Rails proud by helping us reach our lofty goal.

Donations can be made at <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/rails3">http://mycharitywater.org/rails3</a>.
