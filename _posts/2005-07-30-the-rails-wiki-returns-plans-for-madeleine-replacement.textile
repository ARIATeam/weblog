The Rails wiki has returned in a trimmed form that abandoned all the previous revisions in order to make Madeleine cope with the pressure. We've surely pressed the backend far beyond its original, humble, personal wiki intentions. With tens of thousands of page revisions, it was just choking.

But have no fear. Instiki will soon be available in a database-backed version that'll be more suitable for public wikis the size of the Rails one.
