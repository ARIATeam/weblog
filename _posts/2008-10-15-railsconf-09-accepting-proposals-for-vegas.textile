"RailsConf 2009":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/ is going to Las Vegas, baby. It's happening from May 4-7 at the Las Vegas Hilton. Last year was an astounding success with probably the best session line-up of any of the many RailsConfs we've had yet. We're hell bent on repeating that for 2009, but we need your help.

The "call for proposals":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/cfp/46 has opened and will stay open until February 17th, 2009. That's a really long call for proposals and we're doing it to get even more timely information available for the conference. If Rails 3.0 magically appears in January, we want to make sure there are sessions covering it.

The registration for the conference will open in January of 2009.
