why the lucky stiff is at it again with his great stuff. This time he has produced a <a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/">microframework called Camping</a> in the spirit and feel of Rails, but clocking in at just 4kb! Sure, it won't do what most people need most of the time. But often, there's good value in doing a bit of what a few people need occasionally. Camping, as the framework is called, fits that description to a T.

And since it conceptually lies close to Rails, you could easily start a quick thing in Camping and then not have too much trouble porting it to be a full-grown Rails application if need be. Camping even uses ActiveRecord to make it all that much easier.

Checkout the insane and <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html">too funny announcement</a> that even includes this classic description of XML sit-ups:
