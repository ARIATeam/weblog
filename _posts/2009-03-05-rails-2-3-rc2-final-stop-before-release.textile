The past month has seen a flurry of activity getting Rails 2.3 solid. We think we've ironed out all the major kinks now, but just to be sure, we're running one last release candidate before it heads off to the presses. So please take some time to test out this release candidate. If we don't get any reports of major blockers, we're going to call this final within a week or two.

We've put together a complete guide for <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html">the Rails 2.3 release notes</a> with all the information on what's new, what's changed, and what's deprecated.

You can install the release candidate with:

<code>gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org</code>
