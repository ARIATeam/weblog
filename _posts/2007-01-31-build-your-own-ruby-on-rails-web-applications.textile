"Patrick Lenz":http://poocs.net/ wrapped up yet another Rails book: "Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Web Applications":http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/5d3acfb/3/96, published by SitePoint.  This one takes a beginners look at the Rails 1.2 framework, building a sample Digg-clone in the process.

bq. Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Web Applications is an easy-to-follow, practical and fun guide to Ruby on Rails for beginners. It covers all you need to get up and running, from installing Ruby, Rails and MySQL to building and deploying a fully featured web application.

*Update:* Patrick posted a few "sample chapters":http://www.sitepoint.com/article/learn-ruby-on-rails of the book at Sitepoint.
