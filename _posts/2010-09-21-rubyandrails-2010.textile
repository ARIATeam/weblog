RubyEnRails returns this year bigger and better as "RubyAndRails 2010":http://rubyandrails.eu, running from 21-22 October in Amsterdam. Talks are in English and entry is just â‚¬149,00.

The "speaker lineup":http://rubyandrails.eu/speakers is shaping up great. Check out the "program":http://rubyandrails.eu/program and "sign up":http://rubyandrails.eu/signup now.

RubyAndRails has been run by volunteers for five years now, growing from a friendly regional gathering to an even friendlier all-European event. The "Rumble":http://rubyandrails.eu/rumble is back this year, too!
