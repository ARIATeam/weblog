Rails core team member "Rick Olson":http://techno-weenie.net shares "five really good reasons":http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2006/4/20/five-reasons-why-your-next-rails-mod-should-be-a-plugin for why you should make your next Rails enhancement patch a plugin rather than submitting a ticket. Great advice.
