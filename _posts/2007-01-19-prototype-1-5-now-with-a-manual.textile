Prototype 1.5 shipped together with Rails 1.2 today. But that's not all that's been happening at the JavaScript sugar mill. Today also marks the official unveiling of "prototypejs.org":http://prototypejs.org. A brand new site dedicated to promoting and teaching Prototype. It comes complete with "API documentation":http://prototypejs.org/api, "a blog":http://prototypejs.org/blog, and "a guide on how to contribute":http://prototypejs.org/contribute. Congratulations to Sam, Justin, and the rest of the team behind the site.
