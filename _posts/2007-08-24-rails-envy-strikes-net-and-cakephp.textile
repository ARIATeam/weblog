The fantastic team at Rails Envy is back with their Apple-style commercials comparing Ruby on Rails to a variety of competing environments. This time they have a one-two punch first "striking .NET":http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/23/Rails-vs-NET and then "doing PHP/CakePHP":http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/24/rails-vs-php. As always, it's funny stuff and really nicely done. Keep it up, boys!
