Dr Nic Williams has charged one of the major strongholds of legacy database compatibility with Rails, "composite primary keys support":http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/. By installing his nimble plugin, you get a very natural API for mapping those blasted composites using @set_primary_keys@ and an array of keys.

It's still a work in progress, but if you have to deal with a legacy database and want to use Rails, this might just be your ticket in.
