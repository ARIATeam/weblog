Sven Fuchs gave a great "presentation at RailsConf Europe about the history and details of the forth-coming I18n support":http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/9/6/the-future-of-i18n-in-ruby-on-rails-railsconf-europe-2008 in Rails 2.2. Well worth reading if you're in need of internationalization services for your current or future app.
