Matz, the creator of Ruby, has <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/rubyCommittersNowOnBasecamp.html">signed up</a> for a <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> account to help the committers team collaborate on the development of Ruby. What an honor.

Note, the intentions are not to use Basecamp as a ticketing system (it's not well suited for that), but rather as tool to help the informal division of labor that's already going on in private and on the committers mailing list.
