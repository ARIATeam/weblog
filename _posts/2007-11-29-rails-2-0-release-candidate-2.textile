After another batch of fixes, tweaks, and buckets of polish, we've prepared the hopefully last step before 2.0 can go final: Release Candidate 2. If nothing major pops up, expect the final version to land within the next week or two at the most.

As usual, we got the latest gems on the gems.rubyonrails.org server and there's "a RC2 tag":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_2-0-0_RC2/ as well. Please put this final test through the ringer so we can get a clean 2.0.0 final release.

If you haven't kept up to date on what's new in 2.0, have a look at "the original preview release announcement":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release. The gem version for this release is 1.99.1. Enjoy!
