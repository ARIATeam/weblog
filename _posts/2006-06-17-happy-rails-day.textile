"RailsDay 2006":http://railsday2006.com/ is in progress!  Teams around the world will be working furiously all day to produce the best application possible in 24 hours.

This year, you can watch the action as it happens with live(ish) "commit stats":http://spectate.railsday2006.com/ and a "Rails Day campfire":https://railsday.campfirenow.com/073dc.  Not quite a spectator sport yet, but "entertaining":http://project.ioni.st/post/837#post-837 none-the-less.
