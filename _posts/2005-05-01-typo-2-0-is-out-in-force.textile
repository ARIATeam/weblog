It took me a week, but dammit, I'll trout the horn of fanfare none the less: <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/04/23/typo-2-0-arrives">Typo 2.0 is out!</a> Typo is that little weblogging engine that Tobias started while he was waiting for a client in a coffee shop, but which has now attracted an entire team around it. And boy, is it ever looking great!

It seems that I'm out of excuses for still running this blog on WordPress. I can't wait to port it over to Typo within the foreseeable future.
