While the extraction process is happening with pulling the Ajax abstractions that work out of Honey for inclusion in Rails, you might want to take a look at Dave Goodlad's <a href="http://hieraki.goodlad.ca/read/book/1">Combining XMLHttpRequest and Rails to Produce More Efficient UIs</a> Heiraki book. It describes how easy it is to do Ajax with Rails even without the sweet wrapping we're extracting from Honey.
