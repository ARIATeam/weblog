Microsoft's Robert Scoble is <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/19/i-made-phil-ripperger-stand-in-line-for-an-xbox-360/">concerned about the exodus of developers</a> like Phil Ripperger that are leaving .NET for Ruby on Rails. Phil put it like this:

<blockquote><i>Scoble, as a web developer who is now doing freelance work for a living, my framework of choice is Ruby on Rails. Mostly for the reasons listed <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/01/ross-doesnt-trust-microsofts-approach-to-web/">here</a>. And also because Microsoft's web development technologies have lost their appeal. I can remember being blown away by ASP.NET when I first saw it. I now feel even more strongly about Rails. And when I talk to businesses and friends who are developers, I make sure they know about Rails.<br/><br/> Sure, I know about the new Visual Studio, ASP.NET 2.0, the new SharePoint, and the new SQL Server. And I just don't care. Microsoft needs to capture some of the 360 magic and use it on their web development technology or they will continue to lose developers like me.</i></blockquote>

Scoble is inviting people to tell him and Microsoft why .NET and family just isn't doing it for them any more. If you have a good story to share, do let them know.
