We were served with a "cease and desist" from Raindance Communications, Inc. over the use of their registered trademark SWITCHTOWER on Friday. This led to a wild three-day brainstorming session and a new name for SwitchTower: _Capistrano_.

New gems and so forth will be available tomorrow, as well as updated documentation using the new name. For existing SwitchTower users, you'll need to run @cap -A .@ on each of your projects, once the new gems are available and installed. (@cap@ is the new name of the @switchtower@ utility.)

You can read all about the brainstorming process and how the new name was selected "on Jamis' blog":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/03/06/switchtower-renamed.
