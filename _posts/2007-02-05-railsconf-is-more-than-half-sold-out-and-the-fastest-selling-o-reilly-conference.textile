The "registration form":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/register.html for "RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ is still glowing hot after a weekend that ensured that we're now more than half sold out for the conference! This makes RailsConf '07 the fastest selling conference that O'Reilly have been involved with.

If we continue with this rate, we'll be sold out before the end of the week. That's 1200 seats. Not too shabby for a framework not even three years old and a conference only in its second year. 

It's going to be an amazing festival in Portland, that's for sure. I can't wait to get up there and talk about Rails 2.0.
