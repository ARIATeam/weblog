Xavier Defrang has been following the heated arguments about Rails for some time and got fed up with a bunch of "...bogus statements (FUD?) and issues raised in the TSS discussion". So he went ahead with <a href="http://defrang.com/index.php?story=837">a summary of the claims and why he believed them to be without merit</a>. 

I particularly like the code snippet for putting the "code embedded in HTML is evil" nonsense to rest:

<img src="http://defrang.com/img/rails_ww2.png" />

Of course, you could even write that snippet as a single readable line:

<pre>&lt;%= @collection.collect { |item| content_tag "li", item.some.nested.property } %></pre>

Code embedded in HTML is only evil when you're not using a programming language suitable for the purpose and when you don't apply sound principles of abstractions.
