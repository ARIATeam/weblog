Most Rails applications are deployed in a Unix server environment. Tools like "Capistrano":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17 make this dead easy. For those working in a Windows environment, deployment can get considerably harder. The good news is that it's still possible and just got a lot easier.

Brian Hogan has developed "a series of articles":http://www.napcs.com/howto/rails/deploy/ with instructions for various methods of deploying Rails applications in a Windows server environment. Broken up across four articles, the topics covered are as follows:

 * "Serving Multiple Rails Applications on Windows with Apache and Mongrel":http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/RailsWithApacheAndMongrel.pdf
 * "Integrate Rails into an Existing IIS Web infrastructure using Apache and FastCGI":http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithApacheFCGI.pdf
 * "Integrate Rails into an Existing IIS Web infrastructure using Mongrel":http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithMongrel.pdf
 * "Integrate Rails into an Existing IIS Web Infrastructure using Lighttpd and Mongrel":http://www.napcsweb.com/howto/rails/deployment/railsonIISWithLighttpdAndMongrel.pdf

Cheers to Brian for sharing the fruits of his labor.
