After months and months of deliciously teasing screenshots, the real deal is now out for the world to see. The "official Ruby language website":http://www.ruby-lang.org/ has been redesigned. And what a wonderful design it is. Congratulations to the visual identity team and the contributors. It's truly a work to be proud of.
