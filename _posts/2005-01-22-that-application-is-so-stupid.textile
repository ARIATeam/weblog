Just as Patrick Lightbody <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000399.html#comments">recants</a> his <a href="http://www.lightbody.net/~plightbo/archives/000144.html">ill-guided charge</a>, Geert Bevin &mdash; also involved with a Java web-framework, this time <a href="https://rife.dev.java.net/">RIFE</a> &mdash; picks up the torch and tries his best to <a href="http://www.uwyn.com/blog/archives/000108.html">scorch the earth</a> anew:

<blockquote><i>About tadalist, that application is so stupid that I'm wondering how the hell it could have taken him 600 lines to write it. Also, the hugely hiped 'killer application' of RoR, Basecamp, is a total fraud imho. The screenshots look nice, and are nicely presented. So I did make an account and started using it. And honestly, everything they say is true, it sets itself apart in simplicity. Not difficult to write that in a few weeks.</i></blockquote>

It's incredible how much vile bile that lies within the Java community. I'm beginning to understand why many of the defectors I've talked to are so happy about the Ruby and Rails communities. Oh well, back to the stupid, fraud applications.
