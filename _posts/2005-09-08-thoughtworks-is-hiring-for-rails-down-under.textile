<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com.au/index.html">ThoughtWorks</a> is <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2005/09/thoughtworks-hiring-in-australia.html">hiring people with design and development skills in Ruby on Rails</a> in three cities down under: Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney.

I met with their CEO and a select team in Chicago a few months back. They're serious about giving Ruby on Rails a shot to push J2EE and .NET out of their oligarchical strangle hold on the enterprise. It's exciting to see them move on that objective.
