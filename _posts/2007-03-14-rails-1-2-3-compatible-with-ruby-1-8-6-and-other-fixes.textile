While Rails Edge continues to move forward at a rapid clip, we've still had the time to make sure that Rails 1.2.x stays in the game. This release irons out the few wrinkles there was between Ruby 1.8.6 and Rails 1.2.2. So now you can enjoy the latest Ruby with the latest Rails.

Besides the 1.8.6 compatibility, we've included a few minor fixes. Nothing major. This should be a drop-in replacement for Rails 1.2.2.

As always, you can upgrade with gems or use the latest svn tag (rel_1-2-3). Enjoy!
