Pelle Braendgaard just launched and "announced":http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2005-January/001442.html a new free Rails service entitled <a href="http://www.soapbx.com/">SoapBX</a> that let's you use a combination of <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/">Textile</a> and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> to forget about Powerpoint and Keynote:

About the development of SoapBX using Rails, Pelle writes:

<blockquote>I got an idea less than two weeks ago and now as a testament to the
power of Rails I have released the first initial beta version of
SoapBx, with less than 20 hours of programming involved so far.</blockquote>

Congratulations on the launch, Pelle!
