Rails has absorbed <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/report/5">~219 patches</a> since the ticketing went Trac around the release of Rails 0.7. That's almost _three patches applied per day_. Quite the barn raising. Seems like we're keeping the pace too with more than 20 patches awaiting to be applied from over the last week. And I even did apply a few. And some of these "patches" are huge things like a DB2 and a finished SQL Server adapter.

The open source is working.
