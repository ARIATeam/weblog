Rails 2.2 is going to make it much, much easier to do internationalized sites. Check out Clemens Kofler's "sample app running live":http://i18n-demo.phusion.nl/ or "peruse his code":http://github.com/clemens/i18n_demo_app/tree/master. Thread safety? Internationalization? What stock objections to Rails will we have left?!
