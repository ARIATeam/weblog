Weâ€™ve released Ruby on Rails 2.3.9 ("gem":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/2.3.9 and "git tag":http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v2.3.9) to extend the 2.3.8 bridge a few steps closer to Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9. If your app runs on Rails 2.3.9 without deprecation warnings, you're looking good for an upgrade to Rails 3.

h4. Deprecations

* Changes i18n named-interpolation syntax from the deprecated <code>Hello {{name}}</code> to the 1.9-native <code>Hello %{name}</code>.
* Replaces <code>Kernel#returning</code> with <code>Object#tap</code> which is native to Ruby 1.8.7.
* Renames <code>Array#random_element</code> to <code>Array#sample</code> which is native to Ruby 1.9.
* Renames <code>config.load_paths</code> and <code>.load_once_paths</code> to the more accurate <code>config.autoload_paths</code> and <code>.autoload_once_paths</code>.

Along with these deprecations come a broad array of bugfixes and minor tweaks. Read the "commit log":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v2.3.8...v2.3.9 for the full story.

Onward to 3.1!
