We've been taking our sweet time, but now it really is almost there. We've just pushed new beta gems to gems.rubyonrails.org and created "the rel_2-0-0_RC1 tag":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_2-0-0_RC1/. So this is shaping up to be the last chance to raise concerns for Rails 2.0 before we go final in oh-so-shortly.

So please give it a spin. First, upgrade to 1.2.5 if you haven't already. Fix all the deprecation warnings you see. Then try to jump on Rails 2.0 and see if it runs. If it doesn't, and you think it's not because of something you did wrong, please create a ticket.

We're going to be running this release candidate phase over the next couple of weeks, give or take depending on how many issues are raised.

You can read all about why you should actually care about Rails 2.0 in "the original preview release announcement":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release.

The gem version for this release is 1.99.0.
