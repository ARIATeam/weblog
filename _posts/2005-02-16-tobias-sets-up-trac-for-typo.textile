Tobias Luekte has set up a Trac site for his <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/read/2">Typo</a> weblog engine. Typo has a slew of neat features including:

* XML-RPC backend implementing the metaweblog api. MarsEdit and other desktop clients work great.
* Comments
* Textile by way of RedCloth
* fulltext search
* RSS2 and Atom export
* CommentRSS export
* Some use of caching and sweepers

So whether you'd like to run it or not, you'll probably do well by having a look at <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/">the source</a>.
