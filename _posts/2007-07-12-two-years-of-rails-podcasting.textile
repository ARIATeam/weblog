bq. Two years ago today, "Scott Barron":http://twitter.com/JoyentScott published the "first episode":http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/david_heinemeier_hansson of the "Ruby on Rails Podcast":http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/. -- "Geoffrey Grosenbach":http://nubyonrails.com/articles/two-years-of-the-ruby-on-rails-podcast

Wow, has it been two years already?  Geoffrey's been a major positive force in the Rails community even longer then that, starting with the humble "Pluralizer":http://nubyonrails.com/tools/pluralize/octopus, which helped us all figure out what table names our ActiveRecord models were supposed to be using.  For his next podcast, he's turning the tables and letting himself be interviewed by "Dan Benjamin":http://hivelogic.com.  Be sure to send in some challenging questions (see Geoffrey's blog post for details).

Congrats on the milestone, Geoffrey, Scott, and everyone else that's been involved with the Rails Podcast!
