Paul Graham delivered one of the keynotes to an audience of about 550 people this weekend at "RailsConf":http://railsconf.org. The text of his talk, "The Power of the Marginal":http://digg.com/programming/The_Power_of_the_Marginal, is now online. Hold tight for full video of almost all the keynotes in weeks to come. They will be made available for free to download.

For now, relive the weekend or catch up to what went down with a bunch of "pictures":http://flickr.com/photos/tags/railsconf/ and "commentary":http://www.bloggingrailsconf.com/.
