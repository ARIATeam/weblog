Just because you're forced to run Windows at work shouldn't preclude you from getting jiggy with Ruby on Rails. The Windows crowd on the Rails mailing list have been working over time putting the pieces of the puzzle together and Boris have made a very nice <a href="http://www.bitslapped.nl/articles/2005/06/05/rails-on-windows-2003">write-up of how to repeat it</a>.

Nice work indeed! Now. Can we get Rails running on my Sony PSP :)?
