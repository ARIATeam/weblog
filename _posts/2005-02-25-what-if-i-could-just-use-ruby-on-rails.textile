Jaikoo <a href="http://blog.jaikoo.com/2005/02/23/i-just-keep-forgetting/15/">wonders</a> what the world would look like if he could just develop purely in a dynamic environment:

<blockquote>One of the things I&rsquo;m currently working on is this massively complex J2EE application running on JBoss. The thing I still can&rsquo;t get used to is bouncing Apache (thats running a full blown Rails app). I mean it starts from cold in like 3 seconds on my live server. That can&rsquo;t be right? After all JBoss 3.2.3 takes around 5 minutes to startup on the equivilent server. Yes, I know I&rsquo;m comparing apples with oranges, but sometimes I just wonder how much more productive I&rsquo;d be if I developed purely in dymanic languages such as Ruby or Python.</blockquote>

Of course, during development you don't even have to restart anything to see your changes instantly reflected. It's change'n'reload, baby.
