Thomas Baustert and Ralf Wirdemann are working on <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/15/web-entwicklung-mit-ruby-on-rails/">the German book</a> for Ruby on Rails and they're also spreading the word around the country. Two days ago they did the <a href="http://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/">Java Forum Stuttgart</a>, which is a gathering of some 800 Java programmers. Ralf summarizes the feedback:

<blockquote>Our presentation was also well attended by more than 100 people. We got excellent feedback and many developers were impressed about the simplicity and less code of Rails application.</blockquote>

Very nice. It'll be interesting to see if a similar reaction will be had at JAOO when <a href="http://www.jaoo.dk/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=54">I enter the lion's cave</a>.
