"Stephan Kaes":http://railsexpress.de/blog/, our resident performance expert, has released a "new version of RailsBench":http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2007/04/01/new-railsbench-release-0-9-2.  He then created new "Rails 1.2 vs Rails 1.1 benchmarks":http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2007/04/01/rails-1-2-performance, discovering that things aren't as bad as they seem.  Of course, those numbers won't mean a whole lot until you read the "full report":http://railsexpress.de/blog/files/reports/rails1.1-stable_vs_rails1.2-stable/report.html
