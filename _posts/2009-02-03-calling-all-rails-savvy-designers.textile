One thing that has been a continuing challenge for many Rails developers is finding a good designer to work with. There are certainly plenty of fantastic designers out there, but it's often difficult to find one who is comfortable working directly in a Rails project.

In an effort to help ease this challenge, and at the behest of some interested developers and designers, the Rails Activists have set up a group for "Ruby Graphics Designers":http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-graphic-designers. The idea is to have a place for communication: a spot where designers can ask questions about git or erb, or where developers can try to find a designer to work with.

Of course, a group without participation is nothing to crow about. If you're a developer - or especially if you're a designer who works with Rails - we'd love to have your participation. If you're interested in the visual design and information architecture of Rails applications, c'mon by and say hi! And if you have other ideas about how we can encourage closer collaboration between the Rails community and the design community, we'd love to hear them.
