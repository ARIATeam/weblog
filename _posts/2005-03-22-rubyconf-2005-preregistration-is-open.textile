Let me tell you where you're going to be on October 14th through 16th. You're going to be in San Diego, California. That's right. RubyConf just opened the doors for the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/prereg/dispatch.cgi?controller=main&amp;action=index">preregistration</a> (which incidentally is a Rails app by David Black) and I managed to grab the entry with ID = 1 in the database. So you know I'm going to be there. Are you?
