"David A. Black's":http://www.rubypowerandlight.com  book "Ruby for Rails":http://www.manning.com/black/ is now available in full in PDF form (paper copy scheduled to follow the first week of May). The book covers the ins and outs of Ruby with a focus on Rails. It is aimed at Rails developers who want to gain a deeper understanding of Ruby beyond what Rails builds on top of it.

Taking a look at the "table of contents":http://www.manning.com/black/excerpt_contents.html you'll get a sense of how much territory the book covers. There are two sample chapers for free. One is on "Organizing objects with classes":http://www.manning-source.com/books/black/black_ch05.pdf and the other on "Scalar objects":http://www.manning-source.com/books/black/black_ch10.pdf. 

David Black is an ideal guide through Ruby,  having been a member of the community for over 5 years and as the director of "Ruby Central":http://rubycentral.org/, the not for profit organization that brings you "RubyConf":http://www.rubyconf.org/ every year.

It's no secret that Ruby is one of the key ingredients in Rails' special sauce. If you are a Rails developer, you owe it to yourself to be a Ruby master. "Ruby for Rails":http://www.manning.com/black/ is a great place to start.
