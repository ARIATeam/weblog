Tonight at the Software Development Jolt Awards, Rails won the best web development tool award while the canonical Rails book, "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html, won for best technical book. They find themselves both in "fine company":http://www.sdmagazine.com/jolts/previous.htm.

Both "DHH":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000573.html and "Dave Thomas":http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/Random/SecondJolt.html share their reactions.
