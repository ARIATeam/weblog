As mentioned "last week":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/05/18/weekly-interactive-guides-with-kevin-clark,  "Kevin Clark":http://glu.ttono.us/ is taking your suggestions and developing weekly guides that cover the ins and outs of Rails.

He's delivered on his first guide: "Environments in Rails 1.1":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/22/guide-environments-in-rails-1-1.        The accompaying "Cheat Sheet":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/22/configuring-rails-environments-the-cheat-sheet is particularly noteworthy. It lists all the various configuration options available to you, with a brief description of the purpose they serve.

To have your say on what Kevin covers next, send him your suggestion at kevin dot clark at gmail dot com with [idea] in the subject.
