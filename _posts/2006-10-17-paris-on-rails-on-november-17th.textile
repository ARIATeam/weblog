Regional Rails conferences are popping up all over the place. On November 17th, "Paris on Rails":http://paris.onrails.info/ will go down. It looks like it'll be a great show for all French speaking people out there. And they got some nice sponsors lined up, such as IBM and Telecom Italia. Way to go.

If you want to sign up, the fee is 60 euro.
