John McCreesh has published a great new 30+ paged tutorials for getting started with Rails entitled Four Days on Rails.

<blockquote>Rails is well documented on-line; in fact, possibly too well documented for beginners, with over 30,000 words of on-line documentation in the format of a reference manual. What&rsquo;s missing is a roadmap (railmap?) pointing to the key pages that you need to know to get up and running in Rails development... Four Days on Rails is designed to fill that gap.</blockquote>

McCreesh's has his <a href="http://rails.homelinux.org/">own site</a> for the book, but I've also taken the liberty to do a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/text/Rails4Days.pdf">mirror for the book</a>.
