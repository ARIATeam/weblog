LiteSpeed Web Server is a commercial product that offers a free version for private and commercial use. With release 2.2, "LiteSpeed Technologies":http://www.litespeedtech.com has embraced the Rails community and provided built-in support for deploying Rails Applications.
 
According to their website, they are "the world's best performing Ruby SAPI and easiest Ruby on Rails application setup".  I put their claims to a test in a couple of "screencasts":http://i.nfectio.us/articles/2006/09/04/litespeed-web-server-2-2-includes-rails-support for your viewing pleasure.

If you haven't checked out LiteSpeed yet, give it a "try":http://www.litespeedtech.com/products/webserver/download/.
