"Scott Raymond":http://scottraymond.net/ latest book, "Ajax on Rails":http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527440/, has recently been published by O'Reilly.  He also wrote "What's New in Prototype 1.5?":http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2007/01/24/whats-new-in-prototype-15.html on XML.com regarding the latest changes for Prototype 1.5.

* The book demonstrates how to use Ajax and Rails to build
high-performance, scalable applications without having to write reams of
difficult-to-maintain JavaScript code.
* Provides a thorough, low-level understanding of what's under the hood,
with a high-level understanding of how to use Ajax techniques
effectively.
* Includes a complete reference to Prototype 1.5 and script.aculo.us 1.6.1,
which can be used even outside of the Rails platform. 
* Three fully worked out applications--a quiz program, a photo gallery, 
and a workgroup collaboration tool--show how everything fits together 
in practice.
