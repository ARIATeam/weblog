Despite my initial resistance, Olivier Hericord pressed on and prevailed -- against my own odds -- to produce a remixed version of the new logo that was <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2004/12/29/variations-on-a-railed-theme/#comments">greeted</a> by the majority of the community as an improvement. And I concur. The remix signals less rigidness and more fun than the original -- two important properties to Rails development.

This process also proved that patches are not just for software. Once you <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2004/12/28/open-sourcing-the-rails-logo/">share the source</a>, improvements are bound to occur. That's another reason that I'm welcoming the remix. The community protested, the community acted, the community celebrated change, and now, hopefully, the community <i>moved on</i>.
