We've been part of a Slashdot posting once before, but this is the first time that Rails is actually the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/21/1514234&amp;tid=156">primary topic of one</a>. So a proper welcome to all the Slashdotters flowing in from the article about Curt Hibbs' great new Rails tutorial on O'Reilly's ONLamp.

Hopefully we'll survive the onslaught and a few will stick around!
