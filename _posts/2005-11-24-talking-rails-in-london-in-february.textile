<a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/">The Future of Web Apps</a> is a Summit penned for London in February where people from various parts of the industry will met to talk about.. well.. The FUTURE! 

And so will I, under the banner of "Happy Programming and Sustainable Productivity with Ruby on Rails". So if you have your future groove on and a chance to do London early next year, this is a match.
