Apparently, Ruby-FastCGI is one leaky pipe. It's currently happily disposing of up to 16K per request. Not particularly helpful for the long-running processes like FastCGIs. But have no fear, Kirk Haines is near. And plugged the holes, he has.

Read all about the patch and get it from Kirk's <a href="http://enigo.com/projects/iowa/fcgipatch.html">FCGI Patch for Ruby FCGI 0.8.5</a> page.

Additionally, 0.8.5 isn't raising the original exception when it dies, which makes it pretty hard to debug. But luckily, Aredridel made a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/patches/fastcgi_0-8-5_original_exception.diff">patch to get the original exception bubbled up</a> a while back. Apply that while you're at it.

Note: As Ruby-FastCGI has <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/nahiVacuumsAndAimsFebrezeAtRaa.html">temporarily disappeared</a> from the RAA listing, you might like to know that the direct link is <a href="http://www.moonwolf.com/ruby/archive/ruby-fcgi-0.8.5.tar.gz">http://www.moonwolf.com/ruby/archive/ruby-fcgi-0.8.5.tar.gz</a>
