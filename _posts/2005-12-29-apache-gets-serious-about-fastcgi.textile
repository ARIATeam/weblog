Brian McCallister <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/apache_22_fcgi.html">reports</a> that the Apache team has decided to revive mod_fcgi as <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/fcgi-proxy-dev/modules/proxy/mod_proxy_fcgi.c">mod_proxy_fcgi</a> with intentions of proper support for external FCGIs and a place in the core Apache distribution. 

This is fantastic news! Paul Querna and Garrett Rooney deserves much praise for embarking on this important quest to restore our faith in Apache as a worthy web server for applications. Not only will this mean that FCGI is no longer a bastard child on Apache 2.x, but also that it'll have active maintenance and people to turn to if things are sour.

Speaking of sour. Please do forward all your grapes to <a href="brianm@apache.org">Brian McCallister</a> or the <a href="http://fastcgi.com/archives/fastcgi-developers/">FastCGI Developers list</a>. Any trouble you've had in the past with FCGI and Apache or things you'd like to see happen.

Viva la Apache!
