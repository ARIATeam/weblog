Rails performance specialist Stefan Kaes, who writes extensively about optimizing Rails over at "Rails Express":http://railsexpress.de/blog/ has a lengthy article at the new "InfoQ":http://www.infoq.com/ site called "A Look at Common Performance Problems in Rails":http://www.infoq.com/articles/Rails-Performance.

Kaes identifies various development practices that will slow down your Rails applications, such as repeating computations that only need to be run once and then cached. If you've located some slowness in your application, Kaes may have already identified some of the likely culprits.
