We suspected a pattern was emerging as IBM's Sam Ruby first <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/41715395@N00/31541062/">at OSCON reenacted</a> the <a href="http://rubyonrael.com/">original joke from etech</a>, then posted about the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/09/Rails-Confidence-Builder">Rails Confidence Builder</a>, and finally <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/25/Acts-As-Tree">combined that work with Atom</a> using acts_as_tree. Yes, something was in the cards.

And Sam has now played another power-hand in favor of Ruby on Rails:

<blockquote>Next month, I will be presenting at <a href="http://www.fosssl.org/">FOSSSL '05</a> in Colombo, Sri Lanka; first a keynote on Friday entitled The Case for Dynamic Languages, then a tutorial on Saturday entitled Riding Ruby-On-Rails.</blockquote>

That's awesome! If I didn't say it earlier, let me repeat: Welcome to the party, Sam. It's great to have you here. We're honored. Now just one tiny nitpick: "Ruby on Rails", not "Ruby-On-Rails" :)
