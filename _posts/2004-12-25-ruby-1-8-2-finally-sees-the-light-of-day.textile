Ruby 1.8.2 contains a year's worth of bug fixes, so its release was a very welcome Christmas present from the honorable Matz. Among the many fixes and changes are the fact that Dave Thomas' <code>ri</code> documentation system is now included by default. Oh so very welcome. The new release is to find in source form at "ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz":ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz.

Please note, that Rails currently have one known bug when running under 1.8.2 in form of "#354":http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/351 -- soon to be fixed.
