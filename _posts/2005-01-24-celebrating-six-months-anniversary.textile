On July 24th of last year, Rails 0.5 was <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=307">released through RubyForge</a>. It mustered 357 downloads in just five days. Today, fifteen releases later, we've pushed more than ten thousand gems and five thousand tgz/zip versions over the virtual counter. At the time of writing, the IRC channel holds 153 handles. We recently got Slashdotted and a ton of cool applications are coming out using Rails.

We've certainly come quite a long way in six months. 

But its only going to get better. A lot better. Dave Thomas is writing the first book on Rails, the mystical 1.0 release is just 1-2 months away, and there's a number of cool speaking engagements coming up at future conferences that's going to push awareness even higher.

If you're reading this, I salute you for being one of the early adopters (or at least interested) that has helped bring Rails this far. Happy half-birthday, Rails!
