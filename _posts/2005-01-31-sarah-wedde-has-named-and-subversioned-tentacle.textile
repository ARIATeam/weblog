The weblogging system powering Sarah Wedde's ever funny <a href="http://onebefore.org/">One Before</a> has been baptized <a href="http://sarahwedde.org/tentacle/">Tentacle</a> and made <a href="http://sarahwedde.org/svn/tentacle/trunk/">available through SVN</a>. I didn't even know. Yet another example for people to learn from or use as a base for their own weblog on Rails. Thanks, Sarah.
