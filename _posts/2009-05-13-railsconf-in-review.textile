Railsconf wrapped up last week, and I think we all survived Vegas.  If you weren't able to make the conference, there is plenty of video, slides, and blog entries to get a taste of what went on.

First up you can get a summary of the conference by checking out my "Railsconf in 34 minutes video":http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/13/railsconf-video-2.  Thanks to O'Reilly you can also "watch all the keynotes":http://railsconf.blip.tv/posts?view=archive&nsfw=dc, the "Rails Core panel":http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2089905/, the "Women in Rails":http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2082207/ panel, and the "Ruby Heroes Award Ceremony":http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2086061/.  I also put together a few videos during the conference which were played before the Keynotes ("Tutorial Day":http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/5/railsconf-2009-tutorials-day, "Tuesday":http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/6/railsconf-2009-tuesday,  "Wednesday":http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/8/railsconf-2009-wednesday, and a demo of "Rubystein":http://www.railsenvy.com/2009/5/11/rubystein-ruby-meets-wolfenstein thanks to the guys from "Phusion":http://phusion.nl/).  

If you're looking for written material, the slides are "available online":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/proceedings and you can find a great "list of blogs here":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/content/news-coverage which covered the event.

Unfortunately the sessions at the conference weren't recorded, but we're really "hoping":http://www.railsinside.com/events/288-petition-we-think-railsconf-sessions-should-be-recorded-properly.html that this is the last year that happens.
