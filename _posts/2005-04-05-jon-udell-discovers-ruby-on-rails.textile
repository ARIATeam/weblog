Jon Udell discovers Ruby on Rails and shows special affection for Active Record in <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/30/14OPstrategic_1.html">Separating code from its environment</a>:

<blockquote>I've only scratched the surface of Ruby, but when I recently started a project that required a Web-based interface to a SQL database, I reached for Ruby on Rails, because I'd heard it's a great way to automate the tedious chores of Web development. If there is another object-relational mapper that is as powerful and yet as lightweight as Ruby on Rails, I haven't seen it.</blockquote>
