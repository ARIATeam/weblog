We're marching towards the release candidates with hurried steps, but along the way we stopped by for another beta. This one spins out a few overdue extractions into plugins (see "http://github.com/rails/verification":http://github.com/rails/verification and "http://github.com/rails/dynamic_form":http://github.com/rails/dynamic_form), fixes a security issue with cookies, crosses a few t's and dots a few i's. Upgrading from beta 2 is recommended.

As always, you can install the latest beta with <code>gem install rails --pre</code>.

We'll see you again soon for the release candidate.
