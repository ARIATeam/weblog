On a the topic of ASP.NET vs Ruby on Rails on the ruby-talk mailing list, Christian Romney wrote a long analysis over his experience with the two. Here's my choice bit:

<blockquote>I disagree that ASP.NET is  more productive than RoR. I have been FAR more productive with RoR after just a few months of learning Ruby and a few weeks of using RoR than I am with .NET even though I've been coding on the MS platform for 10 years, with half of that time spent almost exclusively working on web applications.</blockquote>

Romney especially likes Active Record and the "architectural guidance" of the framework. But there's definitely also some love for .NET where he especially likes the transaction support and enterprise features like message queueing. <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/47655971c922b9e4">Read the full thing</a>.
