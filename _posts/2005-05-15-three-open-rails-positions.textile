It's a great time to have skills with Ruby on Rails. People are dying to hire you:

* *Illanti Industries:* Canadian Development company looking for a junior-intermediate RoR developer (read: inexpensive) to work on some small applications with us.  Good change to experiment and have fun, with plenty of projects coming in the near future.  For more information, contact: public@illanti.com

* *MyTechSupport:* Hiring a Web Software Engineer to use Ruby on Rails / PHP. "See more on the MTS job site":http://mytechsupport.com/jobs.html.

* *Unknown:* We&rsquo;re looking for a developer with significant rails and Javascript experience for a contract project. The fundamentals of the project are relatively straightforward; we&rsquo;d like to build a working foundation quickly, and then go forwards from there. We&rsquo;re looking for someone with very strong web application UI and client-side Javascript development skills. Please contact Adam Marsh -- adamjmarsh at yahoo.com
