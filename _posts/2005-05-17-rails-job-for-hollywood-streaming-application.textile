Now don't tell me there's no glitz or glamour working with Rails. Tom Wolf from World of Wonder is looking to hire a Rails programmer to build a video delivery system in Ruby on Rails. Straight out of Hollywood:

<blockquote> We are looking for a freelance developer who can help us with a large web project involving video delivery, user accounts, content management and online purchasing.

The developer should have experience building modern, scalable and manageable web applications with ruby. Experience with quicktime streaming sever a plus.

The project is in its initial stages of design, so this is an opportunity for you to put your own ideas into action. Please send an email to twolf@worldofwonder.net for more information.</blockquote>
