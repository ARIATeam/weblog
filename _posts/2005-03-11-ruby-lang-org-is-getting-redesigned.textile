I'm exceedingly happy to <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/redesign2005/">see the rapid progress</a> of the team appointed to redesign ruby-lang.org. The old website served us well, but this redesign is going to make it even easier to declare 2005 The Year of Ruby. 

While both designs are great, I've already fallen in love with John's "Ruby Red" 3.0. The gem is beautiful, the composition is great, and hey, it features Rails on the front page ;). Nix the scoped search into just a single search box and add the participation stuff from clean and we're definitely rolling.

Congrats to _why and the rest of the team behind this!
