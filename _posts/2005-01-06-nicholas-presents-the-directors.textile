Nicholas Seckar is busy working away on the Directors -- the next-generation URL mapping scheme for Rails -- yet still took the time to explain how its going to work. Of course, he chose to use the newly launched SoapBX: <a href="http://www.soapbx.com/viewer/show/34">Rails & Rewriting</a>. Most excellent.
