Tim O'Reilly recently did a piece called "What's on Tim's Radar?". It features a handful of concepts and software that Tim O'Reilly believes to be "...innovative, world-changing, or just plain cool". Guess what's in that fine bunch? Ruby on Rails!

<blockquote>Ruby On Rails: A framework, based on the Ruby programming language for rapid Web development, makes it easier than ever to build a site that draws on a big database. Presto: instant Amazons and eBays!</blockquote>
