He's now also an author of <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_eir/index.html">Enterprise Integration with Ruby</a>, which has just been released as a beta book under the Pragmatic Bookshelf.

Learn all about how to wire enterprise and legacy systems together using Ruby, databases, LDAP, XML, sockets, HTTP, web services, Web Services (TM), and more. There's a <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/fr_eir/ldap.pdf">free chapter on LDAP</a> available, you can checkout the <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/fr_eir/contents.pdf">table of contents</a>, and of course buy the beta book in PDF for $20 or at $37.45 for a paper-when-ready + PDF combo.

Way to go Maik.
