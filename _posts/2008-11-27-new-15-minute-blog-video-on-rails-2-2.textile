The old 15-minute blog video was getting really long in the tooth, so it's with great pleasure that I can present <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts">the new video made with Rails 2.2</a> and done by Ryan Bates. It really takes it all up a notch by showing the creation of a blog with comments, ajax, feed, api, admin interface, and more.

Ryan Bates is also the author of the wonderful <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts.com</a> site that features video explanations on Rails features. It's a fantastic resource and now properly recognized on the screencasting page.

I've also linked up the commercial Rails screencasters. The amount of material available for people interested in learning by video is simply staggering.
