We've been preparing for Rails to move the official source repository from Subversion to "Git":http://git.or.cz/ for some time now and it seems that it'll happen over the next week or so. The premiere will happen alongside the official launch of "Github":http://github.com/.

The move will also mean that we're going to be switching ticket tracking to "Lighthouse":http://www.lighthouseapp.com. So now both our repository and ticket tracking will be powered by Rails applications, which is a nice bonus treat.

When the move happens, we'll freeze the existing Subversion repository and the Trac installation. Both will live on for a long time to come, but will be entirely deprecated. This means that your existing svn:externals will not break, but if you want the latest edge, you'll have to get it from the new git repository.

So now is a great time to learn more about Git in anticipation of this move. I recommend starting with the "Git for SVN'ers crash course":http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html.
