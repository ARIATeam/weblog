<a href="http://www.odeo.com/">ODEO</a> is the upcoming premier portal for podcasting shows. Whether you just want to find and listen or whether you want to create and distribute. Phillip Torrone has a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/06/odeo_minireview.html">mini-review</a> up on O'Reilly's Make magazine. Why is this Rails news? Because ODEO is a Rails application, of course!
