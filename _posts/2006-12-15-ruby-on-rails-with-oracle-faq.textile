Oracle continues blow loving kisses at Rails. This time they've posted a new "FAQ on how to get Rails and Oracle out on the first date":http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/saternos-ror-faq.html. Initial installation and a hello world application is covered.

In addition, Oracle's Justin Kestelyn "promises":http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2006/12/06#a351 that this is just the first of many dates between the two. Keep it flowing.
