"RubyEnRails 2009":http://2009.rubyenrails.nl/?locale=en goes down this 30/31 October in Amsterdam. Talks are in English and Dutch.

RubyEnRails has been all-volunteer for four years running, building on a history of sweet venues, good talks, and great company. It's gradually grown from a local gathering to a full-fledged European event, and this year it's also stepping up to fill the shoes of RailsConf EU.

Yehuda and I are speaking and will be mixing a potent batch of Rails 3 kool-aid. Please join us for a sip!
