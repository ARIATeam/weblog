So now that we've forced our technology of web applications upon the world with Ruby on Rails, we decided to get opinionated about everything else involved too. <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real, the book</a> is a 171-paged PDF that sells for $19 and tries to explain the guiding principles behind <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a>, <a href="http://www.wrieboard.com">Writeboard</a>, <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">Ta-da List</a>, and <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>. The why's and the how's.

If you're doing web application work for yourself or others, there should at least be a handful of essays that gives you a bright idea or the motivation to make a change. And we're giving away four of the 91 essays for you to sample first. Yay, free stuff!
