"Phusion":http://www.phusion.nl/ is on a roll today. Not only did we just get a new Passenger, they've also just dropped a "new REE":http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/05/ruby-enterprise-edition-186-20081205-released-thank-you-sponsors/ (the Ruby patches for copy-on-write) that includes 64-bit support as well as compatibility with OS X and Solaris. They've also fitted the excellent RailsBench patches from Stefan Kaes that allows you to tweak the GC settings in Ruby if you need to.
