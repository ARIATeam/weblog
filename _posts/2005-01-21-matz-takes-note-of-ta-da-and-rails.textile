Matz &mdash; the creator of Ruby &mdash; <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/20050120.html#c">noted the launch of Ta-da List</a> and the fact that it's 579 lines of Ruby on Rails code today. What a great honor, but unfortunately, I can't read Kanji (which I'm ignorantly guessing this is). Perhaps someone could translate?
