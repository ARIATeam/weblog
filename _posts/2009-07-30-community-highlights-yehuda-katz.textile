<span style="font-size: 11pt">Over the past few months, Rails core team member Yehuda Katz has posted a series of great blog articles describing some of the process and technique he's used while coding Rails 3 with Carl Lerche.  In case you haven't followed his blog posts, I thought I'd repost them here for your educational reading.</span>

"Rails 3: The Great Decoupling":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/19/rails-3-the-great-decoupling/ 
is about decoupling components like ActionController and ActionView.

"New Rails Isolation Testing":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/01/new-rails-isolation-testing/

is about the refactoring philosophy he's using when coding Rails 3.

"Rails Edge Architecture":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/06/11/rails-edge-architecture/
is about Rails 3 Architecture including AbstractController::Base & ActionController::Http

"Better Module Organization":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/04/07/better-module-organization/

"alias_method_chain in models":http://yehudakatz.com/2009/03/06/alias_method_chain-in-models/
is about alternatives to using alias_method_chain, some of which made it into Rails 3 refactorings.

"Rails 3 Extension API":http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/version3/start
is where on the new wiki Yehuda has started documenting the new extension APIs which are being added for Rails 3.  There's not a whole lot there yet, but be sure to watch this space in the coming weeks.
