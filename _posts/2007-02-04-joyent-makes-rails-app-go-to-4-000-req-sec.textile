Our friends at TextDrive/Joyent have been slugging away at their seriously impressive mega-cluster for quite some time now and it looks like it's paying off. Just a few days ago, "Shopify announced they were coming over":http://jadedpixel.com/2007/1/31/shopify-is-moving. 

And now Jason Hoffman shares a few statistics on "how they're making a new big Rails app scale":http://joyeur.com/2007/02/04/a-brief-update-with-some-numbers-for-hardware-load-balanced-mongrels to no less than 4,000 requests per second on one of their sub-pages. That's a pretty juicy number and is thanks to their BIG-IP-to-48-mongrels setup for Twitter.

Keep rocking, boys.

BTW, the company's Jason Hoffman will be giving a 3-hour tutorial at RailsConf entitled "Scaling a Rails Application from the Bottom Up":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11694. You'd be well-advised to secure an early seat to that one.
