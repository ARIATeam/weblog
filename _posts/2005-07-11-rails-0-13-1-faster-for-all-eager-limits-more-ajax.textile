We've returned the default MySQL/Ruby bindings to their former glory, made sure development mode on big applications didn't get penalized on resetting the object space, and cut WEBricks lust to have a new database connection per request. All changes that actually allows Rails 0.13.1 to live up to the promise of better performance for everyone.

Additionally, we've made it possible to use :limit and :offset together with eager loading of has_one and belongs_to associations (has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many will still not work due to the nature of how SQL joins work).

And of course there's a big bag of delicious script.aculo.us additions and fixes. Be sure to checkout the changelogs for the full scoop as usual:
