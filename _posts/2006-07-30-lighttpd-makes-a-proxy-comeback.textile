As Mongrel continues to bubble to the top of the preferred production stack, we've started to evaluate web servers on their proxy rather than their FCGI support. The lighttpd crew has heard this change of priorities loud and clear and the coming version will feature a brand new "mod_proxy_core":http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/18/mod_proxy_core-commited-to-svn module, which aims to rectify all the troubles of the old mod_proxy.

Jan Kneschke and crew are busy preparing this proxy module for release with "lighttpd 1.5.0":http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/26/1-4-12-becomes-1-5-0, but you can already now get your toes wet with the "pre-release":http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/24/pre-release-lighttpd-1-4-12-20060724-0947-tar-gz.

All hail "the http pipe":http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2006/06/webaspipe!
