"ObjectiveView":http://www.ratio.co.uk/objectiveview.html, a journal for software developers that focuses each issue on a specific topic, has two Ruby related articles in their latest issue, "New Technologies Focus":http://www.ratio.co.uk/ov9pdf.pdf. 

The first is an introduction to Ruby by "Amy Hoy":http://slash7.com. She brings her quirky right-brained ebullience to bear, providing a thorough yet accessible tour of Ruby. She emphasizes that one of its most salient characteristics is that it makes you happy. If her writing style is any indication, she's loving life.

"ThoughtWorker":http://thoughtworks.com "Obie Fernandez":http://www.jroller.com/page/obie serves up the other article which demonstrats what "DHH's":http://loudthinking.com often cited phrase "opinionated software" means and how it relates to Rails. Keep an eye out for Obie's upcoming book, _Extending Ruby on Rails (Into the Enterprise)_ which is expected out in Fall 2006 by Addison-Wesley.

These two tutorials provide a nice introduction to both Ruby and Rails.

Past issues of ObjectView which focus on such topics as agile development, use cases and componentized development, are also available, so check out the rest of the back issues on their website.
