Jason Hoffman from Joyent had a great tutorial at RailsConf Europe on Scaling a Rails Application from the Bottom Up. It defines the key terms and measurements of scaling and explains why scaling in essence have nothing to do with Rails. It's a great story to have in hand when the inevitable fudzy "But does it scale?" nonsense is thrown at you.
