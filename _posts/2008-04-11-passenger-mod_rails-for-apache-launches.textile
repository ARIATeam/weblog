The guys at Phusion has finally wrapped up <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>, their mod_rails-like module for Apache. It's looking like a great, easy solution for people who want a more PHP-like deployment story. Just dump your files in a directory setup with a vhost and off you go. Touch tmp/restart.txt and the application is restarted. Doesn't get much simpler than that.
