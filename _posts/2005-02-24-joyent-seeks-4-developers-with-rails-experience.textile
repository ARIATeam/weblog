David Young from the San Francisco start-up <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> are looking for 4 developers with Rails experience:

<blockquote>We're looking for four exceptional people, they should have deep experience writing good GUI applications and/or understand the integration of various open-source server products including mail, calendar, directory, samba, and rails. Some experience with Mozilla's XUL is a big plus (it's a bigger plus if they understand why XUL isn't a complete solution). We will provide relocation (and visa, etc. sponsorship) assistance, but relocation is not necessary for the first phase. If desired, relocation would happen in the September, 2005 timeframe.</blockquote>

If you're interested, get in touch with david at joyent dot com.
