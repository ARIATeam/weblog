Several months ago we "announced":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2005/11/17/snakes-and-rubies-in-chicago-on-december-3rd the "Snakes and Rubies":http://snakesandrubies.com/event/ event that took place in Chicago. It was well attended and lively and the entire thing was recorded. The footage is now "available for download":http://www.djangoproject.com/snakesandrubies/.

The recording is approximately 3 hours long so show your thanks to those who are making it avaliable to you by jumping onto the "torrent":http://media.djangoproject.com/snakesandrubies/snakesandrubies.mp4.torrent if you're inclined.
