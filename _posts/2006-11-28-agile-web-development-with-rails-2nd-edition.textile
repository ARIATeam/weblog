How fitting. Just as we're wrapping up Rails 1.2, the book that covers it all has gone into print. I'm talking about "Agile Web Development with Rails, 2nd Edition":http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html, of course. The book that has taught the vast majority of all Rails developers the ropes.

Yes, yes, it'll be available in all its paper glory around December 15th. But you can actually get the final PDF now. Dave Thomas just released the same version as was shipped off to the printers. If you'd like to get access to the information now, but still enjoy reading long sections from paper, there's the combo pack.

The timing is great and so are the sections on RJS, migrations, resources, respond_to, polymorphic associations, and all the other new-fangled wonders that has been introduced to Rails since the last version of the book. Go get it.
