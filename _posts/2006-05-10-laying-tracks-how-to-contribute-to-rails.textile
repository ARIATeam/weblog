"Josh Susser":http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/ is at it again. He's whiped up a PDF presentation called "Laying Tracks":http://hasmanythrough.com/layingtracks/LayingTracks.pdf which details the hows and the whys of contributing patches to Rails.

At just 16 slides, it's short but meaty. He sums up the patch making and contributing workflow succinctly. This should be required reading for anyone looking to submit code to Rails core.
