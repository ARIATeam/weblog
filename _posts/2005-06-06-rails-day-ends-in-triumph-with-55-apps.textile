<a href="http://railsday.com/">Rails Day</a> had a great turnout with <a href="http://railsday.com/svn/qualifiers">55(!) projects</a> crossing the finish line. That's a lot of interesting code generated in no time at all. It's so interesting in fact that the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/06/1135222&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=8">developer section on Slashdot just picked it up</a> -- hi guys!

Now for the judging. We'll be announcing a week's worth of slip on that considering the massive amount of projects to look through, but you'll have plenty of projects to keep you entertained in the mean time.

Congratulations to all who finished.
