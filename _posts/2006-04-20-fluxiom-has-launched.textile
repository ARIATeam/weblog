The wait is over for the next killer Rails application. "Fluxiom":http://fluxiom.com has launched! Digital asset management just got a lot sexier. 

You may have seen its "demo video":http://fluxiom.com/video which has been floating around since last December. Developed by "wollzelle":http://www.wollzelle.com/ with none other than "Thomas Fuchs":http://mir.aculo.us/, aka "Mr. Scriptaculous":http://script.aculo.us/, at the helm, it brings a native desktop app feel to your web browser. Those building Rails applications these days may be familiar with all the swanky effects Thomas has been putting together. Turns out he's had a few tricks up his sleeve. Fluxiom not only helps collect, manage and access your assets, it does it with style.

Fluxiom provides four subscription levels, all of which offer a free 30 day trial. You can "check out the video":http://fluxiom.com/video and then head over to the "sign up page":http://fluxiom.com/pricing/.

We await a bevy of great extractions Thomas ;)
