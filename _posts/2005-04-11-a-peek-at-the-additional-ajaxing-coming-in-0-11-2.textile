The pursuit of Ajax nirvana with Rails is marching ahead with breath-taking haste. Thomas Fuchs has compiled a <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/demos/effects/demo1.html">demonstration page of all the effects</a> that we've added to the package. Web applications are soon going to be hot on the heels of the GUI goodness we've grown accustomed to with OS X.

But not content to show of the effects, Thomas has also recorded two impressive movies demoing the upcoming support for both <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/images/autocomplete1.mov">auto-completion form fields</a> and for <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/images/uploadprogressdemo2.mov">an upload progress bar</a> (which he has been working on together with Sean Treadway).

Thomas has been a driving force behind most of the new effects and the two fantastically cool abstractions of complete approaches. Are you looking to hire someone to inject the good mood of Ajax into your application? Then Thomas is at the forefront of that pack.
