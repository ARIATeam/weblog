<a href="http://www.mscibarra.com/">MSCI Barra</a> is <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/eby/sof/59090149.html">looking for a developer</a> that preferably is already up-to-speed with Ruby on Rails or at least interested in getting it. It's pretty darn cool to see a company like Barra list Ruby as a required skill and Rails as a preferred one.

The short bio on Barra:

<blockquote>Join BARRA, the world's leading provider of analytical investment and trading solutions. Our products are used by many of the most prestigious investment institutions in today's exciting global financial markets to determine investment strategies. More than 2500 organizations worldwide rely on BARRA's unique combination of risk management software, value-added information and consulting as an integral part of their investment process.</blockquote>

The job posting was made to craigslist's San Francisco East Bay Area listing, so I expect its primarily targeting locales in that area.
