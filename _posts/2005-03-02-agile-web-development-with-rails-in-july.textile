It has been made official. The title of the first Rails book is going to be <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and its currently being written by Dave Thomas. A small group of reviewers, including yours truly, have been reviewing the first chapters as they come of Dave's printing fingers already. And it's looking mighty good!

A few choice bits from the introduction to the book:

<blockquote>You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.

You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly.

<b>Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web&#160;2.0 developers.</b></blockquote>
