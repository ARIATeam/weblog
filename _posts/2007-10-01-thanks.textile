Rails 2.0 includes the work of more than 160 individuals who have contributed features through trac and our mailing list.  Our "user mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/ has 11002 subscribers all helping each other out. The "development list":http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core has 1847 people helping improve the framework for all the users.
