There's nothing like an O'Reilly article to get you <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/04/1319242">on the cover of Slashdot</a>. Curt Hibbs is once again the man for writing a great article that boosts awareness about Rails in the process. Once again, welcome Slashdotters!

If you're a happy Rails user, you might want to consider hanging out in the comments and helping others find the resources they need. Perhaps even throw a testimonial in there, if you're really Rails happy ;)
