Having problems getting SwitchTower to work? So was Ryan Heneise, until he discovered that he "wasn't using a supported shell on the remote host":http://www.artofmission.com/articles/2005/12/27/switchtower-gotcha. If the remote hosts are reporting syntax errors when you try to execute a task, make sure you're using a "POSIX-compatible":http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_UNIX/Explanations/Choice_of_Shell shell (although hopefully this restriction will be lifted in the near-ish future).
