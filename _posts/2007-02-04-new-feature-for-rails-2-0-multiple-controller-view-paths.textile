Thanks to "John Long":http://radiantcms.com, Rails now supports "multiple view paths for each controller":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/2754.  For 90% of the apps, this probably won't make a huge difference.  But, for those of you wanting to productize various open source apps, you can now do this:

<macro:code>
/beast/trunk$ mkdir vendor/plugins/test_view_paths
/beast/trunk$ cd vendor/plugins/test_view_paths
/beast/trunk/vendor/plugins/test_view_paths$ mkdir views
/beast/trunk/vendor/plugins/test_view_paths$ echo "ActionController::Base.view_paths.unshift File.join(directory, 'views')" > init.rb
</macro:code>

What you've done is created a minimal rails plugin that inserts a 'views' directory in the plugin to the beginning of the #view_paths array.  Now, copy a view from the rails app into the plugin's 'views' directory, make a noticeable change, and start your app.  You'll notice that it picked your plugin's view over the application's view.
