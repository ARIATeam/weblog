"CUSEC 2006":http://cusec2006.soen.info/ in Montreal this past January featured a great line up of speakers including "Chad Fowler":http://chadfowler.com, "Kathy Sierra":http://headrush.typepad.com/ and "David Heinemeier Hansson":http://www.loudthinking.com/.

Except snow storms in the midwest kept David from making it, so with 12 hours of advanced notice, "Rails Recipes":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/ author Chad Fowler flexed his jazz improv background by whipping up an entertaining, wise and cool-as-cucumber talk in place of David's keynote. The result is "Rails is Boring and Ruby is a Toy":http://media41c.libsyn.com/podcasts/kopanas/001_chad_fowler.m4a. 

Thanks to "SOENlive":http://www.soenlive.com for making the "talk":http://www.soenlive.com/2006/02/26/episode-001-chad-fowler-presents-rails-is-boring available.
