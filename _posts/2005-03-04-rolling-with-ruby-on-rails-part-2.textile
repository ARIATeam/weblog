Curt Hibbs has invaded O'Reilly's ONLamp.com once more to follow up on his hugely popular (and Slashdot linked) article Rolling with Ruby on Rails. In <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/03/rails.html">this second part</a>, he expands on the recipe application by adding additional manipulation tools and categories. The end of the article also contains a summary of the many Rails success stories and a peek at the many features Curt doesn't have time to go into.

While Curt took a lot of flak for claiming Rails to be a silver bullet, it doesn't seem to slow him down. In the conclusion, he writes:

<blockquote>Rails is not your run-of-the-mill, proof-of-concept web framework. It is the next level in web programming, and the developers who use it will make web applications faster than those who don't; single developers can be as productive as whole teams. Best of all, it's available right now, under an MIT license.

I believe that there hasn't been an improvement in productivity like this in recent programming history.</blockquote>
