On January 27th, 37signals will once again be sharing insights, ideas, passion, opinions, and vision on how to build an online business in <a href="https://workshop.37signals.com/">The Getting Real Workshop</a>. We'll be talking about the whole lifecycle including lots of thoughts on software development with or without Rails. 

Yours truly and Jamis Buck will both be presenting and we've traditionally had a lot of great chats about Rails. So if you're considering jumping on board or already have, but needs inspiration to take that somewhere, do join us in Chicago in the beginning of next year.

<b>UPDATE:</b> Sold out. All 50 seats where gone in 12 hours. That's about 14 times as fast as last time.
