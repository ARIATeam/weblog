"Dan Benjamin":http://www.hivelogic.com/, the man who brought "A List Apart":http://www.alistapart.com/ to Rails, has teamed up with web-standards guru "Dan Cederholm":http://simplebits.com/ and launched "Cork'd":http://www.corkd.com/, a free service for wine fans.

Built with Rails, Cork'd lets you rate, review, and catalog the wines you've tried. You can also keep track of wines you'd like to try and buy easily. Best of all, the site has a nice social network aspect to it, where members are encouraged to share and subscribe to each others' reviews and recommendations.
