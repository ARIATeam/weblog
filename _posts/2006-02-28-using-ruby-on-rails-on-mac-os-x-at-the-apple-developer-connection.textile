The "Apple Developer Connection":http://developer.apple.com/ has a nice Ruby on Rails tutorial called "Using Ruby on Rails for Web Development on Mac OS X":http://developer.apple.com/tools/rubyonrails.html.  As the title suggests, it is aimed at getting OS X users off the ground with Rails. 

The Apple Developer Connection doesn't supply any attribution for their articles, but this one was written by none other than "Mike Clark":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom, who along with "Dave Thomas":http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi runs the always-sold-out "Pragmatic Studio":http://pragmaticstudio.com/ series of Ruby on Rails and Ajax training.

Cheers to Mike for taking the time out of his busy schedule to write up a great tutorial.
