Jonathan Nolen and his buddy David has been having a lot of fun <a href="http://www.jnolen.com/blog/2005/05/first_day_on_ra.html">practicing eXtreme Programming with Rails</a> over the weekend. He's most impressed by the support for functional testing:

<blockquote>With Rails, however, you can easily functional testing -- where they go, how they're routed to get there, and whether or not they have the data you expect when they finally render. And it's done in <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/28#page235">a dead-simple way</a>. No Cactus, no mock container, no extra framework to install. It's all built right in. Now, it won't cover everything -- browser differences, javascript, etc. But it covers so much more than we've been able to manage in our Java project.</blockquote>

Thanks, Jonathan. We've tried really hard to make testing so easy that it feels like fun, not a chore. Now that you've checked out functional tests, do dig deeper into the <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/users/scott/posts/mockery">great mock support in Rails</a>.
