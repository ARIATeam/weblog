"Zed Shaw's":http://www.zedshaw.com/ new (mostly) Ruby webserver "Mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ has been getting people's attention lately. What started out as perhaps just an itch has turned into a full time project for Zed, backed by corporate funding.

"Pat Eyler":http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/ caught up with Zed over at "O'Reillynet":http://www.oreillynet.com/ for an "interview":http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/05/post.html where Zed gives some details about the Mongrel project.

Many have already switched their apps over to use Mongrel. Keep an eye on it as an increasingly viable option for serving up your Rails applications.
