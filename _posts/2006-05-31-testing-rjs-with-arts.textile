An Achilles' heal of Rails is no good way to test your RJS. As the presentation behavior gets more and more sophisticated, the inability to test it becomes a real problem. Not anymore.

"Kevin Clark":http://glu.ttono.us/ has released "ARTS":http://thar.be/svn/projects/plugins/arts/, a mechanism to test RJS. His API is simple yet flexible. A single point of entry let's you test a considerable amount of the RJS you can generate. Here's an idea of what you can do:
<pre><code>
  assert_rjs :alert, 'Hi!'                                                     
  assert_rjs :assign, 'a', '2'                                                 
  assert_rjs :call, 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'                                        
  assert_rjs :draggable, 'draggable_item'                                      
  assert_rjs :drop_receiving, 'receiving_item'                                 
  assert_rjs :hide, "post_1", "post_2", "post_3"                               
  assert_rjs :insert_html, :bottom, 'posts'                                    
  assert_rjs :redirect_to, :action => 'list'                                   
  assert_rjs :remove, "post_1", "post_2", "post_3"                             
  assert_rjs :replace, 'completely_replaced_div', '<p>This replaced the        
div</p>'                                                                       
  assert_rjs :replace_html, 'replaceable_div', "This goes inside the           
div"                                                                           
  assert_rjs :show, "post_1", "post_2", "post_3"                               
  assert_rjs :sortable, 'sortable_item'                                        
  assert_rjs :toggle, "post_1", "post_2", "post_3"                             
  assert_rjs :visual_effect, :highlight, "posts", :duration => '1.0'           
</code></pre>
