"The hackfest is back":http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest! In sleek new form, the 'fest runs monthly, starting now.

Without further ado: "it's on":http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest/12-monthly-june-2-7. Two weeks to go. Sprint!

Thanks to Working With Rails for making this an integral part of their site; thanks to O'Reilly for signing on as the "first sponsor":http://workingwithrails.com/hackfest/sponsorship (first prize is a free pass to RailsConf Europe); and thanks to you for contributing the patches and bugfixes that keep Rails at the top of its game.

Go, go!
