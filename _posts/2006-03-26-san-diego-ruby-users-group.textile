There is some action down in San Diego on the Ruby and Rails front. The local "RUG":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/25/san-diego-ruby-users-group-revival, after some time of inactivity, is revving back up. If you live in the area and are keen on meeting up with like minded Rubyists and Railers, take a look over at "Kevin Clark's":http://glu.ttono.us/ blog for more "information":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/03/25/san-diego-ruby-users-group-revival.
