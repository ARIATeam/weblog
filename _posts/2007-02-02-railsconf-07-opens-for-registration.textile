Come May 17th, the Oregon Convention Center in Portland will host "the second annual RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ and if you want to be there, you better get your registration in early. Last year the 600 seats were gone in a week and change. 

We've doubled capacity this year, but the growth of Rails has shot up even faster than that. So if you want to be sure not to miss out, I'd advise you skip reading the rest of this introduction and jump straight to "the registration form":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/register.html.

This year we've teamed up with O'Reilly to produce the conference, which means that silly-nilly details like which "sessions will be available":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/sessions.html are actually ready for you to peruse before signing up. This goes for the new-to-this-year "first day of tutorials":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/tutorials.html too. What a luxury treat. And on top of sessions and tutorials, we'll of course also have a slew of keynotes.

It's going to be one heck of a show. I can't wait to see your all there.
