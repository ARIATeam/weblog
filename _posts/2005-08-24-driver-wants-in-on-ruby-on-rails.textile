Obie Fernandez retells a <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=driver_wants_in_on_rails">cute story</a> from the VP of Marketing at ThoughtWorks, John Guerriere, who met an upcoming Rails developer as his driver to the airport:

<blockquote>john: i was going to the airport and the driver (the car service we use) asks if i know martin fowler.

john: i said yes, why do you ask...

john: he shows me his RoR Agile book by Dave Thomas

john: He taught himself RoR and loves it....

john: Smal world...He used to be a developer b4 he moved from london here...hard time getting a job...</blockquote>
