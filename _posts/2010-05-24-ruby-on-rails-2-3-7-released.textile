With the "2.3.6 release":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/23/ruby-on-rails-2-3-6-released hot out of the oven, Nathan Weizenbaum began updating "HAML":http://haml-lang.com/ to support it. He uncovered a couple of bugs in the HTML-safety changes backported from Rails 3, so we're cutting a "2.3.7":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/2.3.7 release to "fix them":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v2.3.6...v2.3.7.

If you use the "rails_xss":http://github.com/rails/rails_xss#readme plugin for automatic HTML escaping, you should upgrade to Rails 2.3.7 and the latest rails_xss plugin.

If you don't use the rails_xss plugin yet, now's the time to start. It's baked in to Rails 3.

*Update:* fixing compatibility with the rails_xss plugin broke HTML-safety for apps that don't use rails_xss. We're sorry, all: HTML-safety is meant to be opt-in! The fix is available now in "2.3.8.pre1":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/2.3.8.pre1 and will be released shortly.
