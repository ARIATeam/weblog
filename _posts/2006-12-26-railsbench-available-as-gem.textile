Stefan Kaes' "RailsBench benchmarking suite":http://railsbench.rubyforge.org/ is now "available as a gem":http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2006/12/26/railsbench-gem-version-available. This makes it even easier to get started benchmarking your application and find bottlenecks. Yay for ease of installation.
