Marcel Molina and Sam Stephenson are both core developers of Rails and has been riding the express since the very first release of the framework. In that time, they've delivered countless Rails applications and of course contributed to the framework with both code, documentation, and spirit.

If you're looking to get a whole project done for you in Rails or already have a team that just needs some expert guidance, these guys are exactly what you've been looking for.

They're currently accepting new projects, so hurry up. They blog at <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">project.ion.ist</a>.
