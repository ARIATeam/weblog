The decidedly right-brained "Amy Hoy":http://www.slash7.com/ sat down for an "interview":http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/03/15/interview-with-tobi-lutke-of-shopify with with "core member":http://www.rubyonrails.com/core and Rails old-timer "Tobias LÃ¼tke":http://blog.leetsoft.com. They talk about "Jaded Pixel's":http://jadedpixel.com/ greatly anticipated "Shopify":http://shopify.com/ as well as its theme builder, "Vision":http://vision.shopify.com/. Maybe Amy will start doing interviews like this more often...
