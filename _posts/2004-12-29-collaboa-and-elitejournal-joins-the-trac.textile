Reading code written by veterans has always been one of the best ways to learn the way of the arts. And of course, so is it with Rails, which is why I'm particularly pleased to see the trend of sharing your code using the fantastic Trac application take hold. In addition to open repositories for "Hieraki":http://hieraki.leetsoft.com/ and "RForum":http://rforum.andreas-s.net/trac, I've just today added another two:

* <a href="http://collaboa.cocoa.se/trac">Collaboa</a>: The community application running cocoa.se by Johan.
* <a href="http://trac.elitists.net/">EliteJournal & RecipeBox</a>: The weblog and recipe software by Scott Baron.

Are you working on open source Rails software? Why not do it in the open. Get ahold of <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> and start sharing. You'll make the list at "documentation.rubyonrails.com":http://documentation.rubyonrails.com in a split second.
