Robby Russell has <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/04/25/i-am-writing-a-ruby-on-rails-book">announced his authorship</a> of an upcoming book that'll provide "... an in-depth look at RoR, how it works inside and out". The book is to be published by O'Reilly. This will then be their second Rails book (<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/22/4th-book-coming-rails-developer-notebook/">they're already doing a Developer's Notebook</a>) and the fifth book in total announced for Rails. What awesome news!

Hopefully we can get a nice mesh of complimentary books out of all these announcements. We'll want the imminent sea of uptake to acquire the entire shelve of Rails book at the book store. Not worry about choosing.
