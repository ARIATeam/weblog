<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> is the open-source PBX that makes the phone an interesting and hackable device again. But the UI is more than a little geeky, which is where RAGI comes in. It's the <a href="http://ragi.sourceforge.net/">Ruby Asterisk Gateway Interface</a> that serves as a bridge between Ruby on Rails and Asterix. Their pitch goes:

<blockquote>RAGI eases the development of interactive automated telephony applications such as IVR, call routing, automated call center, and extended IP-PBX functionality by leveraging the productivity of the Ruby on Rails framework.  RAGI simplifies the process of creating rich telephony and web apps with a single common web application framework, object model and database backend.   RAGI is available under the BSD license.</blockquote>

Pretty exciting stuff.
