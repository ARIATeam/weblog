The flow of new Rails books seems unstoppable these days and it's hard to keep up with all of the new releases. But there are two books that I've recently have had a chance to taste that I'd like to highlight. 

The first is The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321445619">Rails Way by Obie Fernandez</a>, which I wrote the foreword for. It's a big whooper of a book (900+ pages!), but also a very comprehensive walk-through for the Rails developer who already has his feet wet. It also includes a good dose of community commentary on the how's and why's, which I rather like.

The second is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr">Mike Clark's Advanced Rails Recipes</a>, which is still not finished, but there's a beta book available. It takes up from Chad Fowler's original Rails Recipes book and gives you another 72 how-tos on more in-depth topics, such as REST, deployment, and testing. I've had a chance to taste a few of the recipes already and it's good stuff.

If there's a new Rails book that you really like, write a note in the comments and point people to it.
