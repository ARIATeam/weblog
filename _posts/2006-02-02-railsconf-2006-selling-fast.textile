We opened up "registration":http://railsconf.org/pages/registration for "RailsConf 2006":http://railsconf.org just over 12 hours ago and already have *over 100 people signed up*! Dave Thomas and Mike Clark's "Guidebook":http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook session is also already half full so if you were planning on coming to RailsConf I would act sooner rather than later. 

So go "sign up now":http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=104160.
