David came up with a quick tip for anyone stress testing protected pages with a stateless tester, such as siege.

# Log in with your browser
# View the cookies and find the session id (Firefox has a handy cookie search tool)
# Prepend the queries with ?_<notextile>_session_id=YOURSESSIONID</notextile>_

Now, any requests made will be as though they came from your account.

Do you have any other handy tips for stress testing your Rails applications?
