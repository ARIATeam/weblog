We normally don't cover general-purpose Ruby conferences here, but since <a href="http://rubyfools.com/ruby-cph/conference/">RubyFools</a> is actually going down in the birth place of Rails and I won't be able to be there, I thought the least I could do was mention it.

RubyFools is happening from April 1st through 2nd and will feature Ruby-creator Matz and Dave Thomas of Programatic Programmers as keynotes along with lots of other speakers.

I highly recommend checking it out. Copenhagen is such a nice place to visit.
