You've all noticed the excruciating Rails svn updates and Trac molasses in the last couple of weeks. Following the "release of Rails 1.2":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations we thoroughly overwhelmed our development server, no small feat for a hefty dual Xeon. Congratulations, all, for your hearty Rails appetite! Your sustained Mbps say more than words possibly could.

Our "friends":http://joyent.com/team/jasonhoffman/ at "TextDrive":http://textdrive.com/ have stepped up once again to keep Rails development running smoothly and your production apps deploying predictably. Please give a warm welcome to our new development cluster, a load-balanced crew of SunFires and Thumpers hosting Trac at "dev.rubyonrails.org":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ and Subversion at "svn.rubyonrails.org":http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/.

Subversion will remain available at "the old dev URL":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/ so you needn't touch your live apps. Feel free to migrate to the "new URL":http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/ at your own speed.
