Hot on the heels of Snowdevil, Florian Weber has completed the work to relaunch German e-tailer of pregnancy.. uhm stuff.. <a href="http://www.bellybutton.de/">bellybutton</a>. The shop is part a CMS for the company behind it to manage the content on the site and part a e-commerce operation to take and process orders. And it's very nicely designed too!

In addition to the launch, Florian has written a <a href="http://blog.oaklandcutlery.com/index.php?p=2">short retrospect</a> of the project. He talks about not optimizing too soon, using a strong domain model, and having Damage Control do continuos integration.

The completion of bellybutton should also herald Florian's return to active Rails development. Florian had a lot of interesting developments going in Rails before bellybutton kidnapped him for three months. We're eagerly awaiting his return.
