<a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/12/17#SwitchTower">Mike Clark declares his love for SwitchTower</a>, the distributed deployment manager built for Ruby on Rails. He shows off a few fancy tricks in the love letter, such as how to turn web access on and off when you go down for upgrades. 

I'm with Mike on this lovefest. I couldn't imagine operating the 37signals cluster without it. <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> deserves another round of applause for this fantastic piece of software.
