Since we're all celebrating new releases, it seems only fair to point out that "Haml":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/, an alternative markup format to Rails' RHTML templates, has reached the lofty version of 1.0. It even comes with a plugin for seamless integration with Rails applications, so you really have no excuse not to give it a try. If you're looking for an alternative to RHTML, Haml may just be you. Check it out!
