O'Reilly has "analyzed the book sales once again":http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/state_of_the_co_6.html. Here are the juicy bits about Ruby and Rails books:

<blockquote>In the Web design and development area, it's worth noting that Ruby on Rails has continued its blazing growth, but Ajax books have not. The decline of both PHP and ASP are striking...

...Rails in the bottom middle was a small speck in last year's first quarter post. Now the size of the box fits the size of its name at least. And its market share is almost equal to SQL and has surpassed VBA, Perl and Python. Python is also experiencing good growth, just not at the blazing velocity of Ruby. I would expect by next year, we will see Ruby have an even larger share/square.</blockquote>
