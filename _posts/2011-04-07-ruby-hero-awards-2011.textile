It's that time again to take a moment to think about those who have impacted the Ruby community this year but have not received the recognition they deserve.  We have given away <a href="http://www.rubyheroes.com/heroes" title="Previous Ruby Heroes">eighteen awards</a> in the past three years at Railsconf, and this year we are preparing to give away six more.

h2. But we need your help.

So, if you know someone who has contributed greatly this year please take a moment to show some gratitude by nominating them on "RubyHeroes.com":http://rubyheroes.com.  In two weeks the "Ruby Heroes from last year":http://rubyheroes.com/heroes will look at the nominations and decide who should receive the awards (this way there's no popularity contest).  However, your nominations do matter, so please "take a moment":http://rubyheroes.com and spread the gratitude.

The winners will be announced live on stage at "Railsconf 2011":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011.
