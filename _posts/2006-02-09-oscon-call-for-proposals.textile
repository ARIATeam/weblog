Last year's "O'Reilly Open Source Convention":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/ was a watershed event for Ruby outside of Japan.  Ruby was the well-deserved buzz of the conference.

This year's "call for participation":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/create/e_sess/ is closing late Sunday night.  If you've got something to teach, head on over and drop your Ruby and/or Rails proposal into the hat.
