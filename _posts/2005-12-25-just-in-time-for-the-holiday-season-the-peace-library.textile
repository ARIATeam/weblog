The "Peace Library":http://beta.peacelibrary.org/ is an online index of Conflict Transformation & Peacebuilding information featuring research papers, reports, and news related to the Sri Lanka peace process put together by the non-profit web media company "InfoShare":http://www.info-share.org/.

It's in "beta" but already features "207 publications":http://beta.peacelibrary.org/publications/list wrapped in an attractive interface. Read more about them "here":http://beta.peacelibrary.org/publications/about.

Yet another nice app riding the Rails.
