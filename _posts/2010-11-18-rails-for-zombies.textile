This morning my team over at Envy Labs <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/2010/11/rails-for-zombies-released/" title="Rails for Zombies Released!">released</a> a free online tutorial called "Rails for Zombies":http://railsforzombies.org.  The website combines screencasts with in-browser coding to provide an interactive learning experience teaching the basics of Ruby on Rails.

Learning Rails for the first time should be fun, and "Rails for Zombies":http://railsforzombies.org allows you to get your feet wet without any setup or configuration.  At the moment the application has five episodes.  Each episode consists of a single screencast followed by a group of exercises which must be completed before moving forward.  Once you complete all the labs, you unlock a hidden video which shows you where to go to continue your Rails learning.

If you have any friends who need to get started with Rails, hopefully this will help.
