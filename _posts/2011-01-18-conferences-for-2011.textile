One of the reasons the Ruby and Rails community is so strong and passionate is because of the awesome regional conferences that happen all around the globe on a yearly basis.  Previously on this blog I've gone through the list and highlighted a bunch, but since then "Ruby There":http://RubyThere.com has popped up.

So instead of listing out all the conferences I'm just going to send you over to "RubyThere.com":http://RubyThere.com.

If you dig the Ruby and Rails community I highly recommend you attend one of "these events":http://RubyThere.com and maybe volunteer to help or even sponsor if you can afford to.  It's hard work putting on a conference, and most of the organizers do it for the love of the community (and little to no compensation).
