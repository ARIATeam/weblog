The long-rumoured RailsConf is a reality. We've just <a href="http://railsconf.org/">launched the website</a> and finally announced the dates and place. It's going down in the lovely Chicago Summer on June 22nd through 25th. There are a lot of details yet to be determined, but Dave Thomas and myself are already lined up to keynote.

Further details will soon trickle in. Such as how to propose a talk and naturally how to sign up for the event. We're most likely going to cap the attendance to a hard 400. So if you don't want to miss RailsConf like a lot of people missed RubyConf (which was capped at 200), you'd probably do be well-advised to stay alert on the opening of registrations.

Expect the registration fee to be around $350-400. So if you need to start saving, do that.
