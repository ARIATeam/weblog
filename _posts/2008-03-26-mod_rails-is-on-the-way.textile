Hongli and crew from Phusion have been hard at work for some time to fix the ease-of-deployment issue on Apache with their Passenger project. They now have a video that demos how simple it'll be to install and get running with mod_rails. <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Check it out</a>.

<b>Update:</b> Hongli has posted some <a href="http://izumi.plan99.net/blog/index.php/2008/03/31/benchmark-passenger-mod_rails-vs-mongrel-vs-thin/">promising performance benchmarks for mod_rails</a>.
