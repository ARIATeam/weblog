I got this pitch from UK magazine .net:

<blockquote>.net, the UK's leading internet magazine, is looking for Ruby on Rails 
experts to contribute to articles and tutorials. Please get in touch 
with the editor at lisa.jones@futurenet.co.uk.</blockquote>

Your title as published writer is within reach. Get to it!
