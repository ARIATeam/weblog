"RubyEnRails 2008":http://2008.rubyenrails.nl/ is a Dutch Rails conference happening on June 10th. They still have a few tickets left, so if you're able to go, there's still the option. Lots of good speakers there including Charlie from JRuby, Obie, and the Phusion Passenger guys. I'll be doing a iChat Q&A session as well.
