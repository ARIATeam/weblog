I've been receiving some very moving stories about how people came to be Rails programmers from incredibly diverse backgrounds over the years. I even talked to a taxi driver once who was taking me to the airport that was doing Rails. Or the guys who were looking to quit programming who started enjoying it again with Rails.

All these are powerful stories that I'd love if we could share with the world. So let's try to do that! If you have a great story about how you came to Rails, then please send it to david at loudthinking dot com with the subject "My Rails story". I'll filter all those into a folder and we'll find a way to publish them.
