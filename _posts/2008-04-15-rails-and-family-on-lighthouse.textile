Lighthouse "version 2" deployed yesterday, so I'm officially opening the "Rails Lighthouse tracker":http://rails.lighthouseapp.com up for business.  Other spinoff projects such as "Prototype":http://prototype.lighthouseapp.com and "Capistrano":http://capistrano.lighthouseapp.com have already made the switch. As David has mentioned, this means the current "trac instance":http://dev.rubyonrails.org is deprecated.  It will continue to stay in use for now until everyone has transitioned to Lighthouse.

We're still figuring out the new workflow with git, Github, and Lighthouse.  I'll be working with the "Logical Awesome":http://logicalawesome.com folks to improve the "Lighthouse/Github relationship":http://github.com/blog/41-service-integration.  I'm also working with Tim Pope (author of the awesome "git-trac tool":http://git.tpope.net/?p=git-trac.git;a=summary) and others in #rails-contrib on bringing the same development tools to the new git infrastructure.  Tim also wrote some "best practices for contributing to Rails from git":http://www.tpope.net/rails-git-best-practices.
