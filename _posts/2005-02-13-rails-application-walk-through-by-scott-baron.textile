Scott Baron is walking through the process of creating an application "...used by a university cable television station to manage and generate schedules for their movie channels". He's doing it in several installments and the first two are already available. The <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/view/7">first installment</a> describes the background and the freshly published <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/journal/view/8">second installment</a> walks through the creation of all the models in the system.

Scott promises that the next installment will focus on validations and unit tests and that the whole thing will be packaged as both HTML and PDF when its done. Great work, Scott!
