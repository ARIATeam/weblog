Threat level orange, guys! The release candidate for Rails 2.1 is drawing awfully close, so if you've been sitting on a patch that just must make it in now is the time to rise hell or high water to make it so. Once we cut the release candidate, we'll be loathe to introduce anything but bug fixes to the features already there.

So get in your saddle, cowboy, and make that patch happen. Remember that the party has moved to <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">Github</a> and <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com">Lighthouse</a>. Giddiyap!
