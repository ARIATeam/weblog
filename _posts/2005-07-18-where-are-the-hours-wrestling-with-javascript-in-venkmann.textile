Jaikoo is <a href="http://blog.jaikoo.com/index.php/2005/07/17/thats-kind-of-cool/54/">longing to feel like a man again</a>. And nothing like doing long hours debugging impossible JavaScript has that feel of a hard day's work:

<blockquote>In fact its so easy I feel totally un-masculine right now. Dag nammit, where are the hours wrestling with JavaScript in venkmann? Where&rsquo;s the fun without the pain? I mean the real pain!!! GRRR!!! Come on Rails!! Make me feel like a man again!!! Stop making it so easy for gawd sakes, throw some XML in there or something, make it more cryptic;). So this is me, feeling like a total girly boy right now, signing off from the frilly land of Rails. *starts manicuring nails*</blockquote>

Make it as easy as not to.
