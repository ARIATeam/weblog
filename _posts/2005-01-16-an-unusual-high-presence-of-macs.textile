Most of  the core developers in the Rails community are using Macs and they're certainly not afraid to say so. In the hours surrounding the latest MacWorld, the #rubyonrails channel could just have well have been renamed the Mac Enthusiast channel (actually, it did have the title "Have you ordered your Mac Mini yet?" for a brief moment). But I didn't know that we actually had an evangelist among the Rails users that was featured on Apple.com:

Gianni is known as "yipstar" on #rubyonrails who says "I'm working on a bunch. A Flash/Ruby ecommerce site for my brothers Tee-Shirt company. A couple small rails site for my old employer, simple stuff. And I'm almost done with my delicous clone supped up on steroids." Rock on, Gianni!
