David's RailsConf 2006 keynote, "Discovering a World of Resources on Rails":http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/, is now online. 

In this talk he announced the new ActiveResource project, for consuming REST web services and evangelized his new infatuation with regimenting his domain into simple CRUD operations.

You can get the slides and a slice of David's point of view on all this, over at "LoudThinking":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html.

For those twitching at the flash video player, "Ruby Central":http://rubycentral.org will be making the footage available in the future in an unflashy format.
