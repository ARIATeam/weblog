A significant number of Rails developers have reported problems installing gems with the updated RubyGems release.  If you're experiencing a problem that looks anything like this:


  $ gem update sqlite3-ruby Updating installed gems… ERROR: While executing gem … (NoMethodError) undefined   
    method `refresh’ for #<hash:0x14e0a4c>

...you should remove your local source_cache file.  This is the file that locally caches any gem metadata from the gem server to avoid having to re-download it every time you execute a gem command.  

To discover the location of this file on your system, run the following command:

  $ gem env
  RubyGems Environment:
    - VERSION: 0.9.2 (0.9.2)
    - INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8
    - GEM PATH:
       - /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8
    - REMOTE SOURCES:
       - http://gems.rubyforge.org

The source_cache file should be in the path labeled by GEM PATH.  Removing that file should clear up any related issues.

This solution is a workaround pending a fix by the RubyGems team.
