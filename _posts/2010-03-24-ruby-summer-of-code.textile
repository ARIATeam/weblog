Rails participated in Google's summer of code program for the "first time":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/3/19/get-paid-to-work-on-rails last year. We got "four great projects":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/4/22/2009-rails-google-summer-of-code-projects and three long-term contributors from the effort, including Josh Peek and Jos√© Valim, who've both joined Rails core, and Emilio Tagua, who revitalized Arel and integrated it with Active Record.

We applied again this year but didn't make the cut, so we moped for a day then thought, why not make this happen ourselves. So here we are kicking off the *first Ruby summer of code* together with "Engine Yard":http://www.engineyard.com/ and "Ruby Central":http://rubycentral.org/.

Head over to "rubysoc.org":http://rubysoc.org/ to get started and start following "@rubysoc":http://twitter.com/rubysoc for news.

We're following Google's example closely:
* students are paid a $5000 stipend to work full-time during their summer break
* a group of Ruby gurus volunteer their time as mentors
* mentors vote on student proposals based on usefulness, benefit to the Ruby community, and history of motivated open source contribution

We're looking for full- and half-summer sponsors as well as "individual donations":https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=lsilber@engineyard.com&item_name=Ruby_Summer_of_Code&item_number=Donation&no_shipping=1&return=http://www.rubysoc.org&cancel_return=http://www.rubysoc.org/cancel.html&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP_DonationsBF. We'll fund as many students as we can. Donate this week and our own <s>Aaron aka "tenderlove":http://twitter.com/tenderlove will match it!</s> Aaron tapped out, you dogs :-) Thanks Aaron! Now "Chad":http://chadfowler.com/ and "Kelly Fowler":http://www.kellyjeanne.org/ are matching! "Donate now!":http://rubysoc.org/

Ruby gurus, consider mentoring a student this summer. Volunteering to guide the next generation of Ruby developers is a challenging and rewarding effort.

Students: start your engines! Check out our "ideas list":http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rubysoc/2010/ideas and start brainstorming. *Applications begin on April 5!*
