"JetBrains' IntelliJ":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ has long been the gold standard for Java IDEs. Now the company is taking a shot at turning their suite into a good fit for Ruby and Rails development. This new love is coming in the form of a "new official Ruby plug-in":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/ruby_development.html.

It features assisted Ruby coding, with keyword completion, syntax highlighting, on-the-fly code validation, error highlighting, and Rails templates and generator integration. They even put together a "screencast":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/training/demos/ruby.html to show it off.

Cool stuff. Especially if you already plugged down $400 for a license or work on an open-source project (free license, then).
