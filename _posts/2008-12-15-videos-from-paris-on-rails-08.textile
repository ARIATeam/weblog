I love how so many conferences are recording their sessions. Paris on Rails is another of those conferences and they've recently published "their recordings as both video and audio":http://2008.parisonrails.org/. Most of these sessions are in French, but Michael Koziarski did a great session on Rails Performance that's in English and so was my iChat Q&A session.
