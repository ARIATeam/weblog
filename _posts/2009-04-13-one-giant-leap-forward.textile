As of a few minutes ago, "the first big bunch of Rails 3 changes":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/906aebceedb95d8caa6db6314bc90f605bdfaf2b were merged back to Rails master branch in github. This represents a good deal of work by Yehuda Katz, Carl Lerche, and others. I'll have more to say on the changes later on this week, but for now, just a quick caution: if you're in the habit of using Edge Rails, you should likely switch to the "2-3-stable":http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/2-3-stable branch for the time being. The master branch of Rails will likely take a little while to settle back into something that can be used for anything other than getting a preview of the Rails 3 excitement.
