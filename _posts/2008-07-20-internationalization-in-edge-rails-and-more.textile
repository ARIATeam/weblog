There won't be a Living on the Edge this week, but you won't be starved for info because the Rails community is keeping up.

"Ryan Daigle":http://ryandaigle.com/ has been keeping up with some of the changes on edge Rails and has done a few awesome explanatory posts on them:

* "Easy memoization with ActiveSupport::Memoizable":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/16/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-memoization
* "Nested model mass assignments":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/19/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-nested-models
* "Metaclass accessor":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/7/19/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-get-ur-metaclass (aka the eigenclass)

Perhaps even more noteworthy is the introduction of I18n (internationalization) support to Rails core. Sven Fuchs explains the "technical details and API":http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/the-ruby-on-rails-i18n-core-api as well as the "history of Rails and I18n":http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/7/18/finally-ruby-on-rails-gets-internationalized. I18n support is scheduled to be fully stable in the Rails 2.2 release. Have an interest in internationalization in Rails? Lend a hand with your ideas, feedback, and patches at the "Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/rails-i18n.
