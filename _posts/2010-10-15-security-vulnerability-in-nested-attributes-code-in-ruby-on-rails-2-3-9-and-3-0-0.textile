There is a vulnerability in the nested attributes handling code in some versions of Ruby on Rails.  An attacker could manipulate form parameters and make changes to records other than those the developer intended. This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2010-3933.


* Versions Affected:  3.0.0, 2.3.9
* Not affected:       Versions earlier than 2.3.9 and applications which do not use accepts_nested_attributes_for
* Fixed Versions:     3.0.1, 2.3.10

h2. Impact

An attacker could change parameter names for form inputs and make changes to arbitrary records in the system.  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

The 3.0.1 and 2.3.10 releases are available at the normal locations. The 3.0.1 release consists solely of 3.0.0 with the security issue fixed, 3.0.2 will follow shortly and include other bugfixes as well as this fix.  2.3.10 is a regular release in the 2.3 series.
