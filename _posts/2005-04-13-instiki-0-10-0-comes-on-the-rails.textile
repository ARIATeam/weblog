Alexey Verkhovsky has completed the transition of Instiki to a Rails-based core that uses the latest versions of all the framework instead of the '03 dialects it was currently running. Instiki is still powered by Madeleine, though. Which means that it'll be some time yet before you can run Instiki on Apache or lighttpd directly as a move to Active Record or a separate Madeleine process is needed for that to happen.

The new version should be a lot more approachable for Rails hackers, though. And its also a pretty good case of how to use Rails with something else than a database backend. <a href="http://instiki.org/">Dig in!</a>
