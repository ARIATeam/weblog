Since not everyone has yet switched to a Mac and can enjoy the benefits of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, we need people working on better editor and IDE support for other platforms. <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a> is a project to build a cross-platform IDE for Ruby on Rails using the Eclipse platform. It's still very early days, but they have an alpha out you can play with. And there's a lot of activity around the project. Sounds promising indeed.
