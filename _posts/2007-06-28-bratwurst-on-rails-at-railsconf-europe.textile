The Berlin Ruby User Group is throwing a pre-RailsConf party under the banner of <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/">Bratwurst on Rails</a>. 

The Ruby User Group Berlin is one of the biggest in Germany and therefore we're pleased to organize an event on the night before the RailsConf Europe. In the tradition of last year's "Pizza on Rails" the event is called "Bratwurst On Rails."

The event is an opportunity to socialize and meet the conference participants in a relaxed atmosphere, and to make your name or brand known amongst them. Tighten your knots with the community by becoming a sponsor.

The venue will be in the heart of Berlin, close to the conference venue. Entry will be free, as will the food. (If you're interested in sponsoring, have a look at our sponsoring packages and feel free to contact the organisation board via sponsoring@bratwurst-on-rails.com).
